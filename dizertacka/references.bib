	abstract = {CUDA and OpenCL offer two different interfaces for programming GPUs. OpenCL is an open standard that can be used to program CPUs, GPUs, and other devices from different vendors, while CUDA is specific to NVIDIA GPUs. Although OpenCL promises a portable language for GPU programming, its generality may entail a performance penalty. In this paper, we compare the performance of CUDA and OpenCL using complex, near-identical kernels. We show that when using NVIDIA compiler tools, converting a CUDA kernel to an OpenCL kernel involves minimal modifications. Making such a kernel compile with ATI's build tools involves more modifications. Our performance tests measure and compare data transfer times to and from the GPU, kernel execution times, and end-to-end application execution times for both CUDA and OpenCL.},

This paper focuses monitoring aspects, used two methods to calculate CO2 emission, the European Union Emission Trading Scheme and a method developed by the Japanese Iron and Steel Federation, to investigate the effect of the accounting method on the assessment of energy saving by four model steel mills with different levels of energy efﬁciency. Depending on the calculation method used, the calculated energy savings and calculated CO2 emissions for a given mill were found to differ from 5\% to 15\% and 4\% to 14\% respectively, simply by using different calculation methods. Methodologies that evaluate only CO2 emission and track emissions by process may not fully account for energy saving efforts such as using waste heat, generating power using byproduct gases, and energy management efforts applied over the whole mill rather than on a single process. Points of concern in the iron and steel industry are identiﬁed in the areas of calculating energy saving, determining CO2 emissions, and setting benchmarks.},

Several workers have observed swelling of high carbon droplets when exposed to oxidising slags. In the present work, the authors present data on swelling rates measured by X-ray fluoroscopy and compare this with the total volume of gas evolved during the reaction. It is shown that only a small percentage of the gas generated is retained in the droplet to contribute to swelling. The gas generation rate is shown to be controlled by the rate of nucleation of CO bubbles inside the droplet. The critical supersaturation pressure for nucleation is found to be two orders of magnitude less than predicted from theory, which is in keeping with many other studies on nucleation of gases in liquids. However, the effect of surface tension, temperature and saturation pressure shows quantitative agreement with theory.},

	abstract = {Physical modelling of the basic oxygen furnace (BOF) was undertaken with the object of developing an overall ﬂow pattern within the vessel as a function of ﬂuid-ﬂow dynamics/vessel geometry interaction. The study was initiated as the result of localised refractory wear occurring in the knuckle region of a BOF vessel. The occurrence of the wear coincided with a change in lance tip design. This preferential wear limited the campaign life of the vessel. Modelling the ﬂuid dynamics of the system was to examine any possible relationship between ﬂuid-ﬂow patterns and this refractory wear pattern. The 4-fold symmetry of the newer lance tip allowed the application of a quadrant sector model of the bath. This simpliﬁed the ﬂow to the effect of an individual nozzle. A scale of 1/6th was chosen on the basis of the bath depth and ﬂow rates required. Results from this work indicate that waves may have a role in this localised wear. The multiphase system of the BOF involving supersonic gas jets, molten iron and slag, and the interaction between these, ensure that there is no single model, in which all facets of similarity may be satisﬁed simultaneously. This is the major problem in modelling the BOF.},

	abstract = {Engineering simulation is essential to modern engineering design, although it is often a computationally demanding activity which can require powerful computer systems to conduct a study. Traditionally the remit of large desktop workstations or off-site computational facilities, potential is now emerging for mobile computation, whereby the unique characteristics of portable devices are harnessed to provide a novel means of engineering simulation. Possible use cases include emergency service assistance, teaching environments, augmented reality or indeed any such case where large computational resources are unavailable and a system prediction is needed. This is particularly relevant if the required accuracy of a calculation is relatively low, such as cases where only an intuitive result is required. In such cases the computational resources offered by modern mobile devices may already be adequate. This paper proceeds to discuss further the possibilities that modern mobile devices might offer to engineering simulation and describes some initial developments in this direction. We focus on the development of an interactive ﬂuid ﬂow solver employing the lattice Boltzmann method, and investigate both task-based and threadbased parallel implementations. The latter is more traditional for high performance computing across many cores while the former, native to Android, is more simple to implement and returns a slightly higher performance. The performance of both saturates when the number of threads/tasks equal three on a quad-core device. Execution time is improved by a further 20\% by implementing the kernel in C++ and cross-compiling using the Android NDK.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a fractional step lattice Boltzmann method is proposed to model two-phase ﬂow with large density differences by solving a modiﬁed Cahn-Hilliard phase-ﬁeld equation and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. In order to maintain the interface proﬁle and conserve the volume, the normal ﬂux in the original Cahn-Hilliard equation is removed and a proﬁle-corrected term to enforce the interface to be a hyperbolic tangent proﬁle is added. The modiﬁed Cahn-Hilliard equation is split to two subequations. One is the original CH equation and the other is the correction equation. Both the original CH and the hydrodynamic equations are solved by the lattice Boltzmann method. The correction equation is solved by the ﬁnite difference method. With the multi-relaxation-time collision model and a high-order compact selective ﬁlter operation employed in the lattice Boltzmann method, numerical stability is much improved. Compared with the previous lattice Boltzmann methods, the proposed method is able to maintain the order parameter within a physically meaningful range, which is capable of tracking the interface accurately. The proposed method can also simulate two-phase ﬂuid ﬂows with the density ratio up to 1000. Several benchmark problems, including single vortex deform of a circle, translation of a drop, stationary droplet, capillary wave and rising bubble with large density ratios, are presented to validate the accuracy and efﬁciency of the present method.},

	abstract = {A fractional step lattice Boltzmann method (FSLBM) is developed for incompressible ﬂuid ﬂow in three dimensions. The presented scheme is based on the time-evolution of velocity and pressure in contrast to the evolution of probability density functions. Furthermore, the discretization with coarse corrective steps (CCS) facilitates calculations up to large Reynolds numbers. The method is validated for the friction factor of pipes with various surface roughness, as well as, for the Reynolds stress of smooth pipes. A good agreement is found to general scaling laws and high quality DNS data respectively. Development of turbulent ﬂow in a pipe calculated with ≈ 0.57 × 109 lattice elements on a single GPU is reported. FSLBMs can process 56.6 million elements per GB of GPU memory which is considered a near-optimum memory eﬃciency for 3D lattice Boltzmann calculations.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a comparative study between the pseudopotential Shan-Chen model and the phase ﬁeld multiphase lattice Boltzmann method for simulating bubble dynamics during dendritic solidiﬁcation of binary alloys. The Shan-Chen method is an efﬁcient lattice Boltzmann multiphase method despite having some limitations, including the generation of large spurious currents. The phase ﬁeld model solves the Cahn-Hilliard equation in addition to the Navier-Stokes equation to track the interface between phases. The phase ﬁeld method is more accurate than the Shan-Chen model for simulation of ﬂuids with a high-density ratio since it generates an acceptable small spurious current, though at the expense of higher computational costs. For the simulations in this article, the multiphase lattice Boltzmann model was coupled with the cellular automata and ﬁnite difference methods to solve temperature and concentration ﬁelds. The simulated results were presented and compared regarding the ability of each model to simulate phenomena at a microscale resolution, such as Marangoni convection, the magnitude of spurious current, and the computational costs. It is shown that although Shan-Chen methods can replicate some qualitative features of bubble-dendrite interaction, the generated spurious current is unacceptably large, particularly for practical values of the density ratio between ﬂuid and gas phases. This occurs even after implementation of several enhancements to the original Shan-Chen method. This serious limitation makes the Shan-Chen models unsuitable to simulate ﬂuid ﬂow phenomena, such as Marangoni convection, because the large spurious currents mask completely the physical ﬂow.},

	abstract = {The lattice Boltzmann method is an efﬁcient computational ﬂuid dynamics technique that can accurately model a broad range of complex systems. As well as single-phase ﬂuids, it can simulate thermohydrodynamic systems and passive scalar advection. In recent years, it also gained attention as a means of simulating chemical phenomena, as interest in self-organization processes increased. This paper will present a widely-used and versatile lattice Boltzmann model that can simultaneously incorporate ﬂuid dynamics, heat transfer, buoyancy-driven convection, passive scalar advection, chemical reactions and enthalpy changes. All of these effects interact in a physically accurate framework that is simple to code and readily parallelizable. As well as a complete description of the model equations, several example systems will be presented in order to demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of the method. New simulations, which analyzed the effect of a reversible reaction on the transport properties of a convecting ﬂuid, will also be described in detail. This extra chemical degree of freedom was utilized by the system to augment its net heat ﬂux. The numerical method outlined in this paper can be readily deployed for a vast range of complex ﬂow problems, spanning a variety of scientiﬁc disciplines.},

A gas–liquid–solid interaction model is established by combining the lattice Boltzmann method and the immersed boundary method. The deformation and the surface velocity of the bubble, as well as the streamlines of the flow field, are studied as the bubble bypasses a single spherical obstacle or passes between a pair of such obstacles. It is found that for the case of a single sphere, the rise velocity reaches a minimum value at the moment at which an annular bubble forms and the whole sphere is enveloped by the bubble. The initial distance between the bubble and the sphere, as well as the ratio of their sizes, has distinct influences on bubble shape and rise velocity. For a pair of spherical obstacles, the rise velocity of the bubble reaches a minimum value twice as the bubble rises between the obstacles. The distance between the two obstacles has a stronger influence on bubble motion than does their size, although when the two obstacles are of different sizes, the bubble will deviate toward the smaller one.},

Using the proposed method, a practical case of a fuel droplet impacting on a dry surface at high Reynolds and Weber numbers is simulated and the evolution of the spreading ﬁlm diameter agrees well with the experimental data.

	abstract = {Over the past few decades, tremendous progress has been made in the development of particle-based discrete simulation methods versus the conventional continuum-based methods. In particular, the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method has evolved from a theoretical novelty to a ubiquitous, versatile and powerful computational methodology for both fundamental research and engineering applications. It is a kineticbased mesoscopic approach that bridges the microscales and macroscales, which offers distinctive advantages in simulation ﬁdelity and computational eﬃciency. Applications of the LB method are now found in a wide range of disciplines including physics, chemistry, materials, biomedicine and various branches of engineering. The present work provides a comprehensive review of the LB method for thermoﬂuids and energy applications, focusing on multiphase ﬂows, thermal ﬂows and thermal multiphase ﬂows with phase change. The review ﬁrst covers the theoretical framework of the LB method, revealing certain inconsistencies and defects as well as common features of multiphase and thermal LB models. Recent developments in improving the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic consistency, reducing spurious currents, enhancing the numerical stability, etc., are highlighted. These efforts have put the LB method on a ﬁrmer theoretical foundation with enhanced LB models that can achieve larger liquid-gas density ratio, higher Reynolds number and ﬂexible surface tension. Examples of applications are provided in fuel cells and batteries, droplet collision, boiling heat transfer and evaporation, and energy storage. Finally, further developments and future prospect of the LB method are outlined for thermoﬂuids and energy applications.},

In the GFDM, the spatial derivative terms are expressed as linear combinations of neighboring-node values with different weighting coefﬁcients using the moving least-square approximation. An explicit formula for the SFDE is then obtained. The numerical solution is achieved by solving a sparse linear system. Four numerical examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Numerical analysis indicates that the relative errors of prediction results are stable and less than 1\% (0.001–1\%). The method can also be applied for irregular grids with acceptable accuracy.},

Lat-Net employs convolutional autoencoders and residual connections in a fully differentiable scheme to compress the state size of a simulation and learn the dynamics on this compressed form. The result is a computationally and memory efﬁcient neural network that can be iterated and queried to reproduce a ﬂuid simulation.

This study develops a multilayer MRT-LBM to solve the multilayer Saint-Venant equations to obtain horizontal ﬂow velocities in various depths. In the multilayer MRT-LBM, vertical kinematic viscosity forcing is the key term to couple adjacent layers. We implemented the multilayer MRT-LBM to a GPU-based high-performance computing (HPC) architecture. The multilayer MRT-LBM was veriﬁed by analytical solutions for cases of wind-driven, density-driven, and combined circulations with non-uniform bathymetry. The results show good speedup and scalability for large problems. Numerical solutions compared well to the analytical solutions. The multilayer MRT-LBM is promising for simulating lateral and vertical distributions of the horizontal velocities in shallow water ﬂow.},

	abstract = {Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) is a powerful numerical simulation method of the fluid flow. With its data parallel nature, it is a promising candidate for a parallel implementation on a GPU. The LBM, however, is heavily data intensive and memory bound. In particular, moving the data to the adjacent cells in the streaming computation phase incurs a lot of uncoalesced accesses on the GPU which affects the overall performance. Furthermore, the main computation kernels of the LBM use a large number of registers per thread which limits the thread parallelism available at the run time due to the fixed number of registers on the GPU. In this paper, we develop high performance parallelization of the LBM on a GPU by minimizing the overheads associated with the uncoalesced memory accesses while improving the cache locality using the tiling optimization with the data layout change. Furthermore, we aggressively reduce the register uses for the LBM kernels in order to increase the run-time thread parallelism. Experimental results on the Nvidia Tesla K20 GPU show that our approach delivers impressive throughput performance: 1210.63 Million Lattice Updates Per Second (MLUPS).},

We also incorporate transposed indexing of threads to perform TB-level cache optimization for speciﬁc viewpoints. Furthermore, we maximize TB size to exploit spatial locality with fewer resident TBs. For viewpoints with relatively large strides, we synchronize threads of the same TB at regular intervals to realize synchronous ray propagation.

We give a detailed description of our algorithm, focussing on details that are required to achieve a good visual appearance. Furthermore we describe how to implement our adaptive time stepping technique to achieve ﬂexible and stable simulations. We will demonstrate the speed and capabilities of the method with animations from different interactive test cases. These run with, on average, more than 20 frames per second on a standard desktop PC.},

However, by combining a lattice Boltzmann model with the parallel computing power of a graphics processing unit, both real-time compute capability and satisfactory physical accuracy are now achievable. The implementation of an optimized 3D real-time thermal and turbulent fluid flow solver with a performance of half a billion lattice node updates per second is described in detail. The effects of the hardware error checking code and the competition between appropriate boundary conditions and performance capabilities are discussed.},

	abstract = {Mathematical modeling of the combined side and top blowing AOD refining process of stainless steel has further been studied. A new model proposed is generally based on the analysis and assumptions made for the process in our previous investigation. Particularly, the heat transfer characteristics of the vessel are ana- lyzed in terms of the two-dimensional transient heat-conduction problems of composite walls. The heat and mass balances of the system are more comprehensively and precisely performed. The model has been ap- plied to 28 heats of 304-grade austenitic stainless steel refining in a 120 t AOD converter. The results pres- ent that the changes in the composition and temperature of the liquid steel with the time during the whole process can be accurately predicted using the model. The competitive oxidation among the elements in the steel during the oxidative refining with the relevant oxygen distribution ratios, and the competitive reduction of the oxides in the slag during the Ar agitating and reductive refining with the appropriate oxygen supply ra- tios can be well characterized and reasonably determined using the Gibbs free energies of the reactions. The critical carbon concentrations (after which the decarburization alters to be limited by the mass transfer of carbon in liquid steel) for the top, side and combined blowing of 304-grade steel in this work are in the ranges of 0.895 to 0.942, 0.078 to 0.224, 0.144 to 0.255 mass{\%}, respectively. The effects of some factors on the refining result and the optimization of blowing technology have been considered from the model pre- dictions. The model can provide a reliable basis and useful information for determining and optimizing the technology of this AOD process of stainless steel, and controlling the process in real time and on-line.},

	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Given the advantages of artificial neural network, it was used to predict end-point manganese content during BOF steelmaking process, and BP neural network model was esta blished. By means of combining the characteristics of genetic algorithm and BP neural network completely, a combined GA-BP neural network model was established. The verification and comparison of the above three models show that the combined GA-BP neural network model has the highest prediction accuracy. The hit rate of the combined GA-BP neural network model is 90{\%} and 84{\%} respectively when predictive errors of the model are within ±0.03{\%} and ±0.025{\%}. Compared with two models aboved, the combined GA-BP neural network model could provide the most accurate prediction of end-point manganese content, and thus represents a good reference for real production. {\textcopyright} 2012 ISIJ.},

Furthermore, a more practical process model for BOF steelmaking was developed by analyzing the effect of silicon, manganese, oxygen injection rate, oxygen lance height, and bath temperature on decarburization.

It is usually difficult to build a precise BOF endpoint dynamic model because many input variables affect the endpoint carbon content and temperature. For this problem, two effective variables selection steps: mechanism analysis and mutual information calculation are proposed to choose appropriate input variables according to a variable selection algorithm. Then, the selected inputs are weighted on the basis of mutual information values. Finally, two input weighted support vector machine BOF endpoint dynamic models are constructed to predict endpoint carbon content and temperature.
