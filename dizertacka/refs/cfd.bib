	abstract = {The ﬁeld of ﬂuid mechanics is rapidly advancing, driven by unprecedented volumes of data from ﬁeld measurements, experiments and largescale simulations at multiple spatiotemporal scales. Machine learning oﬀers a wealth of techniques to extract information from data that could be translated into knowledge about the underlying ﬂuid mechanics. Moreover, machine learning algorithms can augment domain knowledge and automate tasks related to ﬂow control and optimization. This article presents an overview of past history, current developments, and emerging opportunities of machine learning for ﬂuid mechanics. It outlines fundamental machine learning methodologies and discusses their uses for understanding, modeling, optimizing, and controlling ﬂuid ﬂows. The strengths and limitations of these methods are addressed from the perspective of scientiﬁc inquiry that considers data as an inherent part of modeling, experimentation, and simulation. Machine learning provides a powerful information processing framework that can enrich, and possibly even transform, current lines of ﬂuid mechanics research and industrial applications.},
