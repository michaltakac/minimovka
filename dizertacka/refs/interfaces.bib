	abstract = {This paper describes a study comparing the information recall of participants using 2D and 3D physical visualizations. Speciﬁcally, it focuses on physical bar charts and evaluates the difference between a paper-based visualization and a version built with wooden blocks. We conducted a repeated measures study involving 16 participants in which we measured the recall of information immediately after the exploration and with a delay of one week. We used questionnaires and semi-structured interviews to obtain more information about the process of recall and participants’ opinions whether and how the visualizations differ in their potential for memorizing information. The results point out that participants believe to remember the 3D visualizations better, but besides the recall of extreme values the quantitative data cannot completely verify this appreciation. Furthermore the results highlight that the in the study used physical interaction techniques are not able to compensate lacking visual differentiation. One surprising ﬁnding was the strong dependency of the different data sets on the recall performance.},

	abstract = {Gathering opinions from young children is challenging and different methods have been explored. In this paper we investigated how tangible devices can be used to gather feedback from children in the context of a theater performance. We introduce SmallTalk, a tangible survey system designed for use within a theater space to capture what children, aged 4 to 9, thought of a live performance they had just seen. We describe how the system was designed to build on previous feedback methods that had been tried; while at the same time meeting the constraints of the challenging theater context. We present results from seven deployments of SmallTalk and based on these we briefly discuss its value as a method for evaluating the theater performance. We then look at how the results validated the system design and present several design implications that more generally relate to tangible feedback systems for children.},
