	abstract = {In recent years, as fractional calculus becomes more and more broadly used in research across different academic disciplines, there are increasing demands for the numerical tools for the computation of fractional integration/differentiation, and the simulation of fractional order systems. Time to time, being asked about which tool is suitable for a specific application, the authors decide to carry out this survey to present recapitulative information of the available tools in the literature, in hope of benefiting researchers with different academic backgrounds. With this motivation, the present article collects the scattered tools into a dashboard view, briefly introduces their usage and algorithms, evaluates the accuracy, compares the performance, and provides informative comments for selection.},

	abstract = {The beauty of the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) algorithm for feedback control is its simplicity and efﬁciency. Those are the main reasons why PID controller is the most common form of feedback. PID combines the three natural ways of taking into account the error: the actual (proportional), the accumulated (integral), and the predicted (derivative) values; the three gains depend on the magnitude of the error, the time required to eliminate the accumulated error, and the prediction horizon of the error. This paper explores the new meaning of integral and derivative actions, and gains, derived by the consideration of non-integer integration and differentiation orders, i.e., for fractional order PID controllers. The integral term responds with selective memory to the error because of its non-integer order λ, and corresponds to the area of the projection of the error curve onto a plane (it is not the classical area under the error curve). Moreover, for a fractional proportional-integral (PI) controller scheme with automatic reset, both the velocity and the shape of reset can be modiﬁed with λ. For its part, the derivative action refers to the predicted future values of the error, but based on different prediction horizons (actually, linear and non-linear extrapolations) depending on the value of the differentiation order, µ. Likewise, in case of a proportional-derivative (PD) structure with a noise ﬁlter, the value of µ allows different ﬁltering effects on the error signal to be attained. Similarities and differences between classical and fractional PIDs, as well as illustrative control examples, are given for a best understanding of new possibilities of control with the latter. Examples are given for illustration purposes.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new strategy of the optimal fractional order sliding mode controller (OFSMC) of fractional order non-linear SIMO (Single Input Multiple output) systems based on a division of the global proposed fractional order sliding surface into fractional order sliding sub-surfaces. The optimality of the proposed approach is ensured by the use of PSO algorithm to calculate the parameters λi in sliding sub-surfaces, weighting parameters µi in global sliding surface and gain k of sign function in the Attractant control (discontinuous control). Simulation results demonstrated the eﬀectiveness of OFSMC by comparing it with the optimal conventional sliding mode control OSMC (optimal integer order SMC) applied on fractional order model of inverted pendulum where OFSMC gives excellent results of robustness.},

Using a technique known as the adjoint method, derivatives can be computed efficiently, even for large 3D simulations with millions of control parameters. In addition, we introduce the first method for the full control of free-surface liquids. We show how to compute adjoint derivatives through each step of the simulation, including the fast marching algorithm, and describe a new set of control parameters specifically designed for liquids.},
