	abstract = {We report the results of an extended empirical two-stage study on the aesthetics of hybrid objects that combine form and behaviour. By combining two shapes (spheres and cubes); two sizes (7.5cm and 15cm); two materials (fabric and plastic); and four behaviours (emitting light, emitting sound, vibrating or displaying no behaviour) we created 32 objects that differ for a single feature. In a betweenparticipants study, 175 participants assessed and described the 32 objects. From this, seven dimensions were identified: pleasant; interesting; comfortable; playful; relaxing; special and surprising. In a second between-participants experiment 486 participants rated each object on the seven dimensions from the first study. Overall Spheres, Fabric, and Vibration were the preferred features, but for some of the dimensions specific combinations of features were rated more positively. This paper contribution is twofold: it provides a first study on the aesthetic of tangible interaction as a combination of form and behaviour outlining a potential instrument to measure it; and it provides empirical evidence of the value of experimenting with different forms (spheres) and material (fabric) even if they are difficult to create as they generate the strongest aesthetic effects.},

In this paper we present InfoPhys, a device that enables the direct, tangible manipulation of visualisations. InfoPhys makes use of a force-feedback pointing device to simulate haptic feedback while the user explores visualisations projected on top of the device. We present a use case illustrating the trends in ten years of TEI proceedings and how InfoPhys allows users to feel and manipulate these trends. The technical and software aspects of our prototype are presented, and promising improvements and future work opened by InfoPhys are then discussed.},

Click encourages group learning of coding by turning individual smart devices into code blocks. These code blocks can then be connected to form programs. By contributing more personal devices to the code chain, users are able to increase program complexity. Because code blocks in Click have a physical and virtual component, we designed virtual interactions that encourage physical manipulation of devices. Finally we show example programs that can be built on the system. Code chains are able to use inbuilt and installed smart device hardware and software as inputs/outputs, because of this, the power of resulting programs grow in line with advances in smart device technology.},

The easier and more tangible the interaction, the more likely it is to enhance understanding. This paper presents a tabletop Tangible User Interface (TUI) for interactive data visualization and offers two main contributions. First, we highlight the functional requirements for a data visualization interface and present a tabletop TUI that combines tangible objects with multi-touch interaction. Second, we compare the performance of the tabletop TUI and a multi-touch interface. The results show that participants found patterns faster with the TUI. This was due to the fact that they adopted a more effective strategy using the tabletop TUI than the multi-touch interface.},

Starting from the analysis of four case studies, we illustrate different possible paths through which children can transform embodied experience into an ‘object–to-think-with’ and delineate the different resources for meaning making that they employed. These outcomes contribute to expand the current understanding around embodied learning with interactive technologies, as well as suggest a set of qualities to think about interaction design and future research.},

	abstract = {This article introduces a new interaction model called Instrumental Interaction that extends and generalizes the principles of direct manipulation. It covers existing interaction styles, including traditional WIMP interfaces, as well as new interaction styles such as two-handed input and augmented reality. It defines a design space for new interaction techniques and a set of properties for comparing them. Instrumental Interaction describes graphical user interfaces in terms of domain objects and interaction instruments. Interaction between users and domain objects is mediated by interaction instruments, similar to the tools and instruments we use in the real world to interact with physical objects. The article presents the model, applies it to describe and compare a number of interaction techniques, and shows how it was used to create a new interface for searching and replacing text.},
