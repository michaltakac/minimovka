	abstract = {Efﬁcient simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations for ﬂuid ﬂow is a long standing problem in applied mathematics, for which state-of-theart methods require large compute resources. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach that leverages the approximation power of deeplearning with the precision of standard solvers to obtain fast and highly realistic simulations. Our method solves the incompressible Euler equations using the standard operator splitting method, in which a large sparse linear system with many free parameters must be solved. We use a Convolutional Network with a highly tailored architecture, trained using a novel unsupervised learning framework to solve the linear system. We present real-time 2D and 3D simulations that outperform recently proposed datadriven methods; the obtained results are realistic and show good generalization properties.},

	abstract = {Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a hugely important subject with applications in almost every engineering ﬁeld, however, ﬂuid simulations are extremely computationally and memory demanding. Towards this end, we present Lat-Net, a method for compressing both the computation time and memory usage of Lattice Boltzmann ﬂow simulations using deep neural networks. Lat-Net employs convolutional autoencoders and residual connections in a fully differentiable scheme to compress the state size of a simulation and learn the dynamics on this compressed form. The result is a computationally and memory efﬁcient neural network that can be iterated and queried to reproduce a ﬂuid simulation. We show that once Lat-Net is trained, it can generalize to large grid sizes and complex geometries while maintaining accuracy. We also show that Lat-Net is a general method for compressing other Lattice Boltzmann based simulations such as Electromagnetism.},
