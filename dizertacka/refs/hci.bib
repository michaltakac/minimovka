	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to explore the opportunities of Mixed Reality (MR) as a complementary tool to Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems and to demonstrate the potential beneﬁts on an experimental set-up. The set-up represents an automated logistic process that is highly integrated in a Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) structure. MR is realized through the collaboration between a vision application and a SCADA system and both the opportunities of Augmented Reality (AR) and Augmented Virtuality (AV) are being explored. This results in a monitor based AR supervisory tool on the shop ﬂoor and enhanced SCADA functionalities through AV.},

	abstract = {Wind power plays a key role in reducing global carbon emission. The power curve provided by wind turbine manufacturers oﬀers an eﬀective way of presenting the global performance of wind turbines. However, due to the complicated dynamics nature of oﬀshore wind turbines, and the harsh environment in which they are operating, wind power forecasting is challenging, but at the same time vital to enable condition monitoring (CM). Wind turbine power prediction, using supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data, may not lead to the optimum control strategy as sensors may generate non-calibrated data due to degradation. To mitigate the adverse eﬀects of outliers from SCADA data on wind power forecasting, this paper proposed a novel approach to perform power prediction using high-frequency SCADA data, based on isolate forest (IF) and deep learning neural networks. In the predictive model, wind speed, nacelle orientation, yaw error, blade pitch angle, and ambient temperature were considered as input features, while wind power is evaluated as the output feature. The deep learning model has been trained, tested, and validated against SCADA measurements. Compared against the conventional predictive model used for outlier detection, i.e. based on Gaussian Process (GP), the proposed integrated approach, which coupled IF and deep learning, is expected to be a more eﬃcient tool for anomaly detection in wind power prediction.},
