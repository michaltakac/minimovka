	abstract = {Real-time rendering in the realm of computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) in particular and scientiﬁc high performance computing (HPC) in general is a comparably young ﬁeld of research, as the complexity of most problems with practical relevance is too high for a real-time numerical simulation. However, recent advances in HPC and the development of very efﬁcient numerical techniques allow running ﬁrst optimized numerical simulations in or near real-time, which in return requires integrated and optimized visualization techniques that do not affect performance. In this contribution, we present concepts, implementation details and several application examples of a minimally-invasive, efﬁcient visualization tool for the interactive monitoring of 2D and 3D turbulent ﬂow simulations on commodity hardware. The numerical simulations are conducted with ELBE, an efﬁcient lattice Boltzmann environment based on NVIDIA CUDA (Compute Uniﬁed Device Architecture), which provides optimized numerical kernels for 2D and 3D computational ﬂuid dynamics with ﬂuid-structure interactions and turbulence.},

	title = {In {Situ} {Visualization} {Techniques} for {High} {Performance} {Computing}},
	abstract = {Scientiﬁc visualization for exascale computing is very likely to require in situ processing. Traditional simulation checkpointing and post hoc visualization will likely be unsustainable on future systems at current trends due to the growing gap between I/O bandwidth and FLOPS. As a result, the majority of simulation data may be lost if in situ visualization techniques are not deployed. In situ visualization in this paradigm will be given unprecedented access to simulation output, potentially being able to process all relevant simulation output at every simulation time step, allowing for very high temporal ﬁdelity compared to traditional post hoc visualization. However, this access poses many challenges in terms of data management, resource management and sharing, algorithm development and design, and implementation approaches. Currently, the community primarily relies on two in situ techniques: tightly coupled (on the same resource as the simulation) and loosely coupled (not sharing resources with the simulation). Each of these approaches have positive and negative factors which affect their performance under different simulation, resource, and visualization type constraints. Meaning, that for every given visualization task, it is not generally known which method would give the best performance on every data type, architecture, and set of resource constraints. Due to the lack of research and development on this topic it is still an open research problem requiring future research.},

	abstract = {The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is an open source, permissively licensed, cross-platform toolkit for scientific data processing, visualization, and data analysis. It is over two decades old, originally developed for a very different graphics card architecture. Modern graphics cards feature fully programmable, highly parallelized architectures with large core counts. VTK’s rendering code was rewritten to take advantage of modern graphics cards, maintaining most of the toolkit’s programming interfaces. This offers the opportunity to compare the performance of old and new rendering code on the same systems/cards. Significant improvements in rendering speeds and memory footprints mean that scientific data can be visualized in greater detail than ever before. The widespread use of VTK means that these improvements will reap significant benefits.},
