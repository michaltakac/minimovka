	abstract = {Virtual reality displays, such as head-mounted displays (HMD), afford us a superior spatial awareness by leveraging our vestibular and proprioceptive senses, as compared to traditional desktop displays. Since classical times, people have used memory palaces as a spatial mnemonic to help remember information by organizing it spatially and associating it with salient features in that environment. In this paper, we explore whether using virtual memory palaces in a head-mounted display with head-tracking (HMD condition) would allow a user to better recall information than when using a traditional desktop display with a mouse-based interaction (desktop condition). We found that virtual memory palaces in HMD condition provide a superior memory recall ability compared to the desktop condition. We believe this is a first step in using virtual environments for creating more memorable experiences that enhance productivity through better recall of large amounts of information organized using the idea of virtual memory palaces.},

	title = {A comparative study between a virtual reality heart anatomy system and traditional medical teaching modalities},
	abstract = {The aim of using virtual reality (VR) as a medical training tool is to offer additional means to teach students and to improve the quality of medical skills. A novel system was developed to fulfil the requirements of modern medical education and overcome the challenges faced by both students and lecturers in the process of knowledge transfer. A heart three-dimensional model presented in a virtual reality (VR) environment has been implemented in order to facilitate a new educational modality. This paper reports the outcome of a comparative study between traditional medical teaching modalities and virtual reality technology. This study was conducted in the Faculty of Medicine in the University of Jordan. The participants were asked to perform system trials and experiment with the system by navigating through the system interfaces, as well as being exposed to the traditional physical model of the human heart that is currently used in the faculty during practical anatomy sessions. Afterwards, they were asked to provide feedback via a comparative questionnaire. The participants’ replies to the questions regarding the Physical Heart Model and VR heart anatomy system were assessed for reliability using Cronbach’s alpha. The first group’s (Physical Heart Model questions) α value was 0.689. The second group’s (VR heart anatomy system questions) α value was 0.791. Comparing students’ experience results between the traditional method (Physical Heart Model) and the VR heart anatomy system, the mean scores showed a distinct increase in the values. This indicates that the developed system enhanced their experience in anatomy learning and the provided tools improved their understanding of heart anatomy. Results demonstrated the usefulness of the system by showing a higher satisfaction rate for the provided tools regarding structure and visualisation.},

	abstract = {The recent advances in computer graphics has spurred interest from both academics and industries in virtual reality (VR) enabled training applications. This paper presents a desktop VR prototype for industrial training applications. It is designed and implemented as a general shell by providing the data interface to import both the virtual environment models and speciﬁc domain knowledge. The geometric models of the virtual environment are constructed using feature-based modelling and assembly function by external CAD tools, and then transferred into the prototype through a conversion module. A hierarchical structure is proposed to partition and organise these imported virtual environment models. Based on this structure, a visibility culling approach is developed for fast rendering and user interaction. The case study has demonstrated the functionality of the proposed prototype system by applying it to a maintenance training application for a reﬁnery bump system, which, in general, has a large number of polygons and a certain depth complexity. Signiﬁcant speedup in both context rendering and response to user manipulations has been achieved to provide the user with a fast system response within the desktop virtual environment. Compared with the immersive VR system, the proposed system has oﬀered an aﬀordable and portable training media for industrial applications.},

	abstract = {In this article, efﬁcient computational models for ship motions are presented. These models are used to simulate ship movements in real time. Compared with traditional approaches, our method possesses the ability to cope with different ship shapes, engines, and sea conditions without the loss of efﬁciency. Based on our models, we create a ship motion simulation system for both entertainment and educational applications. Our system assists users to learn the motions of a ship encountering waves, currents, and winds. Users can adjust engine powers, rudders, and other ship facilities via a graphical user interface to create their own ship models. They can also change the environment by altering wave frequencies, wave amplitudes, wave directions, currents, and winds. Therefore, numerous combinations of ships and the environment are generated and the learning becomes more amusing. In our system, a ship is treated as a rigid body ﬂoating on the sea surface. Its motions compose of 6 degrees of freedom: pitch, heave, roll, surge, sway, and yaw. These motions are divided into two categories. The ﬁrst three movements are induced by sea waves, and the last three ones are caused by propellers, rudders, currents, and winds. Based on Newton’s laws and other basic physics motion models, we deduce algorithms to compute the magnitudes of the motions. Our methods can be carried out in real time and possess high ﬁdelity.},

	abstract = {The construction industry has acknowledged that its current working practices are in need of substantial improvements in quality and efficiency and has identified that computer modelling techniques and the use of prefabricated components can help reduce times, costs, and minimise defects and problems of on-site construction. This paper describes a virtual environment to support the design and construction processes of buildings from prefabricated components and the simulation of their construction sequence according to a project schedule. The design environment can import a library of 3-D models of prefabricated modules that can be used to interactively design a building. Using Microsoft Project, the construction schedule of the designed building can be altered, with this information feeding back to the construction simulation environment. Within this environment the order of construction can be visualised using virtual machines. Novel aspects of the system are that it provides a single 3-D environment where the user can construct their design with minimal user interaction through automatic constraint recognition and view the real-time simulation of the construction process within the environment. This takes this area of research a step forward from other systems that only allow the planner to view the construction at certain stages, and do not provide an animated view of the construction process.},

	abstract = {The use of virtual reality (VR) has become a viable alternative to conventional learning methods in various knowledge domains. Wearable head-mounted displays (HMDs) are devices that provide users with an immersive VR experience. To investigate the direct determinants affecting students’ reasons for HMD use in learning, hypotheses relating to information technology acceptance and Kolb’s learning styles were proposed and tested in this study. Participants were recruited through stratified random sampling according to the population ratio of colleges at a university in Taiwan. Students were shown a video on VR applications in learning, after which an online survey was completed. In total, 387 questionnaires were collected of which 376 were valid. An inference analysis of the samples was performed by structural equation modelling with eight exogenous latent variables, namely the four constructs of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) and the four modes of Kolb’s learning styles. All eight variables pointed to one endogenous latent variable: behavioural intention. The results showed all four constructs of the UTAUT to have a positive and significant effect on students’ behavioural intention to use HMDs in learning and only the concrete experience mode of Kolb’s learning styles to have a positive and significant effect. Based on these findings, this study provides suggestions on how to encourage HMDs use in learning to VR developers and educational institutions.},

It can also be used as a diffractometer to obtain the scattering pattern of a material for analysis of its 3D crystal structure. However, the TEM is a very expensive apparatus such that many students do not have a chance to operate it personally, thus causing the difﬁculty of understanding its principle and operating procedure.

An interesting question that arises in the context of VR is whether it appears or feels different to users when different virtual environments are used. This study investigates the effect of VR head-mounted display (HMD) and desktop computer-facilitated VR on users’ sense of presence (spatial presence and immersion) and task-oriented self-efficacy when exposed to an earthquake education VR system. A quasi-experiment design was used with a sample of 96 university students. The results revealed that the VR system had positive impacts on the users’ earthquake preparedness self-efficacy. Although the experiment group (n = 39) had repeated experiences, as they first used desktop VR followed by VR HMD for the same content, users indicated a higher sense of spatial presence and immersion while using VR HMD than when using desktop VR. In addition, a VR HMD single-group pre- and posttest experimental design was performed with 20 participants, and the differences between the pretest and posttest measurements of earthquake preparedness and self-efficacy were determined to be significant. The qualitative results reveal that the visual stimulus and motion are relevant in composing the VR experience.},

We developed the VR Multisensory Classroom (VRMC) as an immersive learning environment within a VR headmounted display, where learners employ hand movements to build hydrocarbon molecules and experience haptic feedback through gloves with built-in sensors and hand-tracking with the Leap Motion system. We report here the evaluation of the first prototype by learners from diverse backgrounds who reported on the ability of the VRMC to support high engagement, motivation, interest and organic chemistry learning as well as diverse learning styles.

The results show that conditions of collaboration without competition in face-to-face environments facilitate better quality of learning to a greater extent. In addition, there are no benefits of intergroup competition over individual competition learning. Thus, in this study, collaborative learning designs without any competition could be considered more consistent with the goal that underpins the main right to education: Each student is able to achieve what he has to achieve, taking advantage of the abilities of each and every agent in the learning community (teacher and students) to do so.

In this paper, we examine the impact that the orientation process has on university students who study computer science and have almost no experience in the use of virtual worlds. Our findings suggest that the orientation process contributed positively to students’ smooth induction and that resulted in having meaningful and engaging interactions.

	abstract = {With the rapid development of the VR market, virtual experience has increasingly been the object of study in recent years. A growing number of studies have reported the positive effect that virtual experience can have on a user’s mood and loyalty. However, few studies have investigated the inﬂuence of the mechanism of virtual experience on users’ mood and loyalty. To compensate for this research gap, this study aims to evaluate consumers’ virtual experience by examining the ﬂow state in a virtual environment. A total of 368 valid questionnaires were collected, and a structural equation modeling approach was employed in the data analysis. The study reveals that forming ﬂow involves many factors: the intrinsic characteristics of the mediated environment, the consumer’s assumptions and perceptions prior to entering the ﬂow state, the stage at which the customer enters the ﬂow state, and the consequences of the ﬂow experience.},

	title = {Real-time body tracking in virtual reality using a {Vive} tracker},
	abstract = {Due to recent improvements in virtual reality (VR) technology, the number of novel applications for entertainment, education, and rehabilitation has increased. The primary goal of these applications is to enhance the sense of belief that the user is “present” in the virtual environment. By tracking the user’s skeleton in real-time, it is possible to synchronize the avatar’s motions with the user’s motions. Although current common devices implement body tracking to a certain degree, most approaches are limited by either high latency or insufficient accuracy. Due to the lack of positional and rotation data, the current VR applications typically do not represent the user’s motions. In this paper, we present an accurate, low-latency body tracking approach for VR-based applications using Vive Trackers. Using a HTC Vive headset and Vive Trackers, we have been able to create an immersive VR experience, by animating the motions of the avatar as smoothly, rapidly and as accurately as possible. An evaluation showed our solution is capable of tracking both joint rotation and position with reasonable accuracy and a very low end-to-latency of 6.71 ± 0.80 ms . Due to this merely imperceptible delay and precise tracking, our solution can show the movements of the user in real-time in order to create deeper immersion.},

In previous works, we highlighted that existing L-system software applications and programs are limited, either in terms of human interaction or in terms of modelling. In particular, few of them allow the user to interact with virtual plants during their growth. Our own L-system engine was developed and called the real-time interactive L-system (RTIL-system). The RTIL-system covers most important L-system extensions such as parametric and context-sensitive features. Furthermore, real-time interactions with the user and the environment with respect to L-system formalism are available. This paper presents an RTIL-system focusing on human interaction, the Partial Interactive Derivation (PID) concept and further progress by the extension of PID to context-sensitive rules. To illustrate the potential of the RTIL-system, the effect of various interactive tasks such as sub-axis additions, pruning and bending on the subsequent dynamic development of virtual plants is described.},

	abstract = {Since the 1950s, 3-dimensional virtual environments (3DVEs) have been developed to simulate real-world experiences. These virtual worlds have evolved with realistic graphics and large numbers of users with whom to engage in virtual representations of real-life situations. This study investigated how students perceived the usefulness of Second Life (SL) as a tool for teaching research methods to a doctoral-level qualitative research class. Two classes of doctoral students were assigned to groups of three students and were charged with conducting an ethnographic study in a SL community. Students conducted observations and interviews of community members as a simulation of conducting ethnographic research in an unfamiliar culture. Data sources included an end-of-course survey, observation field notes, interview transcriptions, journals, discussion board posts, and video conferencing. Nineteen students agreed to have their data included for analysis. Results indicate that SL provided an innovative means for teaching important aspects of qualitative research, such as securing key informants, gatekeeping, observing and taking field notes, and interviewing, among others. Students experienced the affective aspects of conducting research as well, including how to handle rejection and frustration, the need for flexibility, interacting in a strange world, and how to handle awkward situations, sometimes with hilarious results. While the majority of students found SL to be an innovative way to learn research skills, a few experienced technical glitches, causing frustration that hindered their learning. Students created a list of tips for new users of SL to ease their transition into the virtual environment.},

	abstract = {This study employed electroencephalography to record event-related potentials to investigate the difference in learning performance between learners with different levels of spatial ability in a traditional learning environment that utilizes presentation slides and a learning environment that incorporates virtual reality (VR). Thirty-two university students participated in the experiment. The N1 and P2 components were results that indicated selective attention at an early stage; their amplitudes were proportional to the cognitive loads. The experiment results revealed that the main effect of learning environment was significant. The N1 and P2 components had larger amplitudes and indicated higher cognitive loads in the presentation slides-based environment than in the VR-based environment. The main effect of spatial ability was also significant. The N1 and P2 amplitudes evoked in the high spatial ability (HSA) learners were smaller than those evoked in the low spatial ability (LSA) learners, indicating that the LSA learners possessed fewer cognitive resources and bore relatively high cognitive loads. The interaction effect of learning environment and spatial ability was significant. Larger P2 amplitude was observed in LSA learners in the presentation slides-based environment than in the VR-based environment, implying that VR facilitates the reduction of cognitive loads in LSA learners. The P2 amplitude detected in HSA learners did not show any significant difference in both learning environments, indicating that the VR-based learning environment did not enhance their learning. This result supports the ability-as-compensator hypothesis to a certain extent.},

Earlier research is described that supported the development of a virtual recreation of a submerged Mesolithic river valley, discovered during petrochemical surveys of the Southern Basin of the North Sea. Using pollen sample records and vegetation predictions from previous studies, a new alife ‘‘engine’’ was developed that simulated the interaction between ‘‘artiﬁcialised’’ vegetation and environmental factors, thus helping researchers to postulate pre-glacial melting migratory and settlement patterns of ancient civilisations from continental Europe to the British Isles. More recently, and to take advantage of the existence of a more accessible and living ecosystem, work has been conducted in collaboration with the UK’s National Marine Aquarium, this time focusing on the Scylla Artiﬁcial Reef—a Royal Navy frigate scuttled off the coast of Cornwall in South West England. The resulting ‘‘serious games’’-based test beds are now providing the foundation for scientiﬁc investigations into how models and simulations of marine ecologies behave under different measures of complexity. The exploitation of the artiﬁcial life and underwater rendering efforts in others areas, including education and naval training, are also described.},

Visual ﬁdelity signiﬁcantly impacts intrinsic learning, activity in situ, and knowledge gained, independent of other factors. The main empirical contribution of this report is on the impact of the user interface design parameters of graphical ﬁdelity and navigational freedom on learning outcomes. A planned orthogonal contrast, Two-way ANOVA with the factors of Visual Fidelity and Navigational Freedom—both scaled, and set to high and low levels—shows signiﬁcant impacts on the variables of Salient Events, a proxy for discoverybased learning, and Knowledge Gained, as measured between a pre-test and a post-test. Thus, there is strong empirical evidence to support the use of desktop virtual environments, built with high-ﬁdelity, photo-realistic, and free navigational game engine technology, as educational simulations for informal education. The high-level Visual Fidelity combined with the high-level Navigational Freedom condition showed a mean learning gain of 37.44\% and is signiﬁcantly superior to the low-level Visual Fidelity, low-level Navigational Freedom condition, ceteris paribus.},

However the integration of this immense resource in virtual environments (VEs) remains elusive. In this paper we present a Web scriptable user interface that utilizes Web browser technology to enable the user to search the internet for arbitrary information and to seamlessly augment this information into the VE. WebVRI provides access to the standard data input and query mechanisms offered by conventional Web browsers, with the difference that it generates active texture-skins of the Web contents that can be mapped onto arbitrary surfaces within the environment. Once mapped, the corresponding texture functions as a fully integrated Web-browser that will respond to traditional events such as the selection of links or text input. As a result, any surface within the environment can be turned into a Web-enabled resource that provides access to userdeﬁnable data. Using WebVRI, users can merge Web contents into their VE, control its behavior and collaborate with other users inside and outside the VE. This provides a completely new mechanism to access readily available Web-based data, documents, images, animations, simulations and visualization. WebVRI also enables game-based education by providing the ability to create contents rich, pervasive VR-based edutainment environments.},

A brief overview of transfer issues highlights ﬁve main ideas: (1) the type of transfer enables the virtual environment (VE) to be classiﬁed according to what is learned; (2) the transfer process can create conditions within the VE to facilitate transfer of learning; (3) speciﬁc features of VR must match and comply with transfer of learning; (4) transfer can be used to assess a VE’s effectiveness; and (5) future research on transfer of learning must examine the singular context of learning.

	abstract = {The purpose of this review article is to present state-of-the-art approaches and examples of virtual reality/augmented reality (VR/AR) systems, applications and experiences which improve student learning and the generalization of skills to the real world. Thus, we provide a brief, representative and non-exhaustive review of the current research studies, in order to examine the effects, as well as the impact of VR/AR technologies on K-12, higher and tertiary education students’ twenty-first century skills and their overall learning. According to the literature, there are promising results indicating that VR/AR environments improve learning outcomes and present numerous advantages of investing time and financial resources in K-12, higher and tertiary educational settings. Technological tools such as VR/AR improve digital-age literacy, creative thinking, communication, collaboration and problem solving ability, which constitute the so-called twenty-first century skills, necessary to transform information rather than just receive it. VR/AR enhances traditional curricula in order to enable diverse learning needs of students. Research and development relative to VR/AR technology is focused on a whole ecosystem around smart phones, including applications and educational content, games and social networks, creating immersive three-dimensional spatial experiences addressing new ways of human–computer interaction. Raising the level of engagement, promoting selflearning, enabling multi-sensory learning, enhancing spatial ability, confidence and enjoyment, promoting student-centered technology, combination of virtual and real objects in a real setting and decreasing cognitive load are some of the pedagogical advantages discussed. Additionally, implications of a growing VR/AR industry investment in educational sector are provided. It can be concluded that despite the fact that there are various barriers and challenges in front of the adoption of virtual reality on educational practices, VR/AR applications provide an effective tool to enhance learning and memory, as they provide immersed multimodal environments enriched by multiple sensory features.},

This work examines the application of virtual reality (VR) in prototyping service journeys and it hypothesises that VR can recreate service journeys in a highly immersive, agile, and inexpensive manner, thus allowing users to have a representative service experience and enabling service designers to extract high-quality user feedback. To that end, a new service prototyping method, called VR service walkthrough, is presented and evaluated through an empirical comparative study. A VR service walkthrough is a virtual simulation of a service journey, representing how the service unfolds over space and time. A comparative study between the VR service walkthrough method and an adapted service walkthrough method evaluates the application of both methods using a location-based audio tour guide service as a case study. Two user groups (each with 21 users) were used to evaluate both methods based on two factors: the user experience they offered and the subjective meaningfulness and quality of feedback they produced. Results show that the VR service walkthrough method gave a performance similar to that of the service walkthrough method. It was also able to communicate the service concept in an immersive way and foster constructive feedback.},

It allows the learners to get immersed within the 3D scene and explore the shapes which are being modeled visually and haptically. We illustrate this concept using our function-based extension of X3D and VRML. Besides deﬁnition of objects with mathematical functions straight in the scene ﬁle, standard X3D and VRML objects can be converted to tangible ones as well as augmented with function-deﬁned visual appearances. Since the function-deﬁned models are small in size, it is possible to perform their collaborative interactive modiﬁcations with concurrent synchronous visualization at each client computer with any required level of detail.},
