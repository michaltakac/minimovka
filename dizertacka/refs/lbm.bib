	abstract = {The ability to perform credible CFD simulations at accelerated speeds has opened up the potential for a new use-mode for CFD as a tool in engineering: the application of CFD for ﬁrst-order parameter-space exploration, analysis, and design communication. When coupled with a suitable real-time rendering and interaction capability for in-situ visualisation and manipulation of 3D results, CFD may be used as part of an interactive design tool in virtual engineering. These steerable applications represent a paradigm shift in the application of CFD for engineering and oﬀer the potential to transform the way CFD is used within the industry.},

	abstract = {Engineering simulation is essential to modern engineering design, although it is often a computationally demanding activity which can require powerful computer systems to conduct a study. Traditionally the remit of large desktop workstations or off-site computational facilities, potential is now emerging for mobile computation, whereby the unique characteristics of portable devices are harnessed to provide a novel means of engineering simulation. Possible use cases include emergency service assistance, teaching environments, augmented reality or indeed any such case where large computational resources are unavailable and a system prediction is needed. This is particularly relevant if the required accuracy of a calculation is relatively low, such as cases where only an intuitive result is required. In such cases the computational resources offered by modern mobile devices may already be adequate. This paper proceeds to discuss further the possibilities that modern mobile devices might offer to engineering simulation and describes some initial developments in this direction. We focus on the development of an interactive ﬂuid ﬂow solver employing the lattice Boltzmann method, and investigate both task-based and threadbased parallel implementations. The latter is more traditional for high performance computing across many cores while the former, native to Android, is more simple to implement and returns a slightly higher performance. The performance of both saturates when the number of threads/tasks equal three on a quad-core device. Execution time is improved by a further 20\% by implementing the kernel in C++ and cross-compiling using the Android NDK.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a fractional step lattice Boltzmann method is proposed to model two-phase ﬂow with large density differences by solving a modiﬁed Cahn-Hilliard phase-ﬁeld equation and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. In order to maintain the interface proﬁle and conserve the volume, the normal ﬂux in the original Cahn-Hilliard equation is removed and a proﬁle-corrected term to enforce the interface to be a hyperbolic tangent proﬁle is added. The modiﬁed Cahn-Hilliard equation is split to two subequations. One is the original CH equation and the other is the correction equation. Both the original CH and the hydrodynamic equations are solved by the lattice Boltzmann method. The correction equation is solved by the ﬁnite difference method. With the multi-relaxation-time collision model and a high-order compact selective ﬁlter operation employed in the lattice Boltzmann method, numerical stability is much improved. Compared with the previous lattice Boltzmann methods, the proposed method is able to maintain the order parameter within a physically meaningful range, which is capable of tracking the interface accurately. The proposed method can also simulate two-phase ﬂuid ﬂows with the density ratio up to 1000. Several benchmark problems, including single vortex deform of a circle, translation of a drop, stationary droplet, capillary wave and rising bubble with large density ratios, are presented to validate the accuracy and efﬁciency of the present method.},

Furthermore, the discretization with coarse corrective steps (CCS) facilitates calculations up to large Reynolds numbers. The method is validated for the friction factor of pipes with various surface roughness, as well as, for the Reynolds stress of smooth pipes. A good agreement is found to general scaling laws and high quality DNS data respectively. Development of turbulent ﬂow in a pipe calculated with ≈ 0.57 × 109 lattice elements on a single GPU is reported.

The Shan-Chen method is an efﬁcient lattice Boltzmann multiphase method despite having some limitations, including the generation of large spurious currents. The phase ﬁeld model solves the Cahn-Hilliard equation in addition to the Navier-Stokes equation to track the interface between phases. The phase ﬁeld method is more accurate than the Shan-Chen model for simulation of ﬂuids with a high-density ratio since it generates an acceptable small spurious current, though at the expense of higher computational costs. For the simulations in this article, the multiphase lattice Boltzmann model was coupled with the cellular automata and ﬁnite difference methods to solve temperature and concentration ﬁelds. The simulated results were presented and compared regarding the ability of each model to simulate phenomena at a microscale resolution, such as Marangoni convection, the magnitude of spurious current, and the computational costs. It is shown that although Shan-Chen methods can replicate some qualitative features of bubble-dendrite interaction, the generated spurious current is unacceptably large, particularly for practical values of the density ratio between ﬂuid and gas phases. This occurs even after implementation of several enhancements to the original Shan-Chen method. This serious limitation makes the Shan-Chen models unsuitable to simulate ﬂuid ﬂow phenomena, such as Marangoni convection, because the large spurious currents mask completely the physical ﬂow.},

All of these effects interact in a physically accurate framework that is simple to code and readily parallelizable. As well as a complete description of the model equations, several example systems will be presented in order to demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of the method. New simulations, which analyzed the effect of a reversible reaction on the transport properties of a convecting ﬂuid, will also be described in detail. This extra chemical degree of freedom was utilized by the system to augment its net heat ﬂux. The numerical method outlined in this paper can be readily deployed for a vast range of complex ﬂow problems, spanning a variety of scientiﬁc disciplines.},

The deformation and the surface velocity of the bubble, as well as the streamlines of the flow field, are studied as the bubble bypasses a single spherical obstacle or passes between a pair of such obstacles. It is found that for the case of a single sphere, the rise velocity reaches a minimum value at the moment at which an annular bubble forms and the whole sphere is enveloped by the bubble. The initial distance between the bubble and the sphere, as well as the ratio of their sizes, has distinct influences on bubble shape and rise velocity. For a pair of spherical obstacles, the rise velocity of the bubble reaches a minimum value twice as the bubble rises between the obstacles. The distance between the two obstacles has a stronger influence on bubble motion than does their size, although when the two obstacles are of different sizes, the bubble will deviate toward the smaller one.},

	abstract = {Over the past few decades, tremendous progress has been made in the development of particle-based discrete simulation methods versus the conventional continuum-based methods. In particular, the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method has evolved from a theoretical novelty to a ubiquitous, versatile and powerful computational methodology for both fundamental research and engineering applications. It is a kineticbased mesoscopic approach that bridges the microscales and macroscales, which offers distinctive advantages in simulation ﬁdelity and computational eﬃciency. Applications of the LB method are now found in a wide range of disciplines including physics, chemistry, materials, biomedicine and various branches of engineering. The present work provides a comprehensive review of the LB method for thermoﬂuids and energy applications, focusing on multiphase ﬂows, thermal ﬂows and thermal multiphase ﬂows with phase change. The review ﬁrst covers the theoretical framework of the LB method, revealing certain inconsistencies and defects as well as common features of multiphase and thermal LB models. Recent developments in improving the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic consistency, reducing spurious currents, enhancing the numerical stability, etc., are highlighted. These efforts have put the LB method on a ﬁrmer theoretical foundation with enhanced LB models that can achieve larger liquid-gas density ratio, higher Reynolds number and ﬂexible surface tension. Examples of applications are provided in fuel cells and batteries, droplet collision, boiling heat transfer and evaporation, and energy storage. Finally, further developments and future prospect of the LB method are outlined for thermoﬂuids and energy applications.},

In the GFDM, the spatial derivative terms are expressed as linear combinations of neighboring-node values with different weighting coefﬁcients using the moving least-square approximation. An explicit formula for the SFDE is then obtained. The numerical solution is achieved by solving a sparse linear system. Four numerical examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Numerical analysis indicates that the relative errors of prediction results are stable and less than 1\% (0.001–1\%). The method can also be applied for irregular grids with acceptable accuracy.},

Lat-Net employs convolutional autoencoders and residual connections in a fully differentiable scheme to compress the state size of a simulation and learn the dynamics on this compressed form. The result is a computationally and memory efﬁcient neural network that can be iterated and queried to reproduce a ﬂuid simulation.

This study develops a multilayer MRT-LBM to solve the multilayer Saint-Venant equations to obtain horizontal ﬂow velocities in various depths. In the multilayer MRT-LBM, vertical kinematic viscosity forcing is the key term to couple adjacent layers. We implemented the multilayer MRT-LBM to a GPU-based high-performance computing (HPC) architecture. The multilayer MRT-LBM was veriﬁed by analytical solutions for cases of wind-driven, density-driven, and combined circulations with non-uniform bathymetry. The results show good speedup and scalability for large problems. Numerical solutions compared well to the analytical solutions. The multilayer MRT-LBM is promising for simulating lateral and vertical distributions of the horizontal velocities in shallow water ﬂow.},

	abstract = {Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) is a powerful numerical simulation method of the fluid flow. With its data parallel nature, it is a promising candidate for a parallel implementation on a GPU. The LBM, however, is heavily data intensive and memory bound. In particular, moving the data to the adjacent cells in the streaming computation phase incurs a lot of uncoalesced accesses on the GPU which affects the overall performance. Furthermore, the main computation kernels of the LBM use a large number of registers per thread which limits the thread parallelism available at the run time due to the fixed number of registers on the GPU. In this paper, we develop high performance parallelization of the LBM on a GPU by minimizing the overheads associated with the uncoalesced memory accesses while improving the cache locality using the tiling optimization with the data layout change. Furthermore, we aggressively reduce the register uses for the LBM kernels in order to increase the run-time thread parallelism. Experimental results on the Nvidia Tesla K20 GPU show that our approach delivers impressive throughput performance: 1210.63 Million Lattice Updates Per Second (MLUPS).},

However, those computational units necessitate to re-write the program by using a lowlevel language which is suited to those architectures (e.g. CUDA for GPU NVIDIA or OpenCL). In this paper we focus our effort on the performance portability of LBM i.e. the possibility of writing LB algorithms with a high-level of abstraction while remaining efﬁcient on a wide range of architectures such as multicores x86, GPU NVIDIA , ARM, and so on. For such a purpose, implementation of LBM is carried out by developing a unique code, LBM saclay written in the C++ language, coupled with the Kokkos library for performance portability in the context of High Performance Computing. In this paper, the LBM is used to simulate a phase-ﬁeld model for two-phase ﬂow problems with phase change. The mathematical model is composed of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the conservative Allen-Cahn model. Initially developed in the literature for immiscible binary ﬂuids, the model is extended here to simulate phase change occurring at the interface between liquid and gas. For that purpose, a heat equation is added with a source term involving the time derivative of the phase ﬁeld. In the phase-ﬁeld equation a source term is added to approximate the mass production rate at the interface. Several validations are carried out to check step-by-step the implementation of the full model. Finally, computational times are compared on CPU and GPU platforms for the physical problem of ﬁlm boiling.},

	abstract = {GPU performance of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) depends heavily on memory access patterns. When LBM is advanced with GPUs on complex computational domains, geometric data is typically accessed indirectly, and lattice data is typically accessed lexicographically in the Structure of Array (SoA) layout. Although there are a variety of existing access patterns beyond the typical choices, no study has yet examined the relative efﬁcacy between them. Here, we compare a suite of memory access schemes via empirical testing and performance modeling. We ﬁnd strong evidence that semi-direct addressing is the superior addressing scheme for the majority of cases examined: Semi-direct addressing increases computational speed and often reduces memory consumption. For lattice layout, we ﬁnd that the Collected Structure of Arrays (CSoA) layout outperforms the SoA layout. When compared to state-of-the-art practices, our recommended addressing modiﬁcations lead to performance gains between 10-40\% across different complex geometries, ﬂuid volume fractions, and resolutions. The modiﬁcations also lead to a decrease in memory consumption by as much as 17\%. Having discovered these improvements, we examine a highly resolved arterial geometry on a leadership class system. On this system we present the ﬁrst near-optimal strong results for LBM with arterial geometries run on GPUs. We also demonstrate that the above recommendations remain valid for large scale, many device simulations, which leads to an increased computational speed and average memory usage reductions. To understand these observations, we employ performance modeling which reveals that semi-direct methods outperform indirect methods due to a reduced number of total loads/stores in memory, and that CSoA outperforms SoA and bundling due to improved caching behavior.},

The upcoming of Graphic Processing Units (GPU) Computing offered a possible solution for the performance issue, and methods like the Immersed Boundary (IB) algorithm proved to be a flexible solution to boundaries. Unfortunately, the implicit IB algorithm makes the LBM implementation in GPU a non-trivial task. This work presents a fully parallel GPU implementation of LBM in combination with IB. The fluid-boundary interaction is implemented via GPU kernels, using execution configurations and data structures specifically designed to accelerate each code execution. Simulations were validated against experimental and analytical data showing good agreement and improving the computational time. Substantial reductions of calculation rates were achieved, lowering down the required time to execute the same model in a CPU to about two magnitude orders.},

A subset of the discussed implementations of the propagation step were benchmarked on diﬀerent Intel and AMD-based compute nodes using the framework of an existing ﬂow solver which is specially adapted to simulate ﬂow in porous media. Finally the estimated performance is compared to the measured one. As expected, the number of memory transfers has a signiﬁcant impact on performance.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to improve the bounce-back boundary treatment for moving surfaces with arbitrary configurations. We follow the framework originally proposed by Ladd [A.J.C. Ladd, Numerical simulations of particulate suspensions via a discretized Boltzman equation. Part 1. Theoretical foundation, Journal of Fluid Mechanics 271 (1994) 285–309]; however, the adjustment in the density distribution during the bouncing-back process at the boundary is calculated using the midpoint velocity inter-/extrapolated from the boundary and fluid velocities, instead of the real boundary velocity in the Ladd method. This modification ensures that the bouncing-back process and the density distribution adjustment both take place at a same location: the midpoint of a boundary lattice link, and thus removes the discrepancy of bouncing-back at the midpoint but density distribution adjustment at the boundary point in the original Ladd method. When compared with other existing boundary models, this method involves a simpler algorithm and exhibits a comparable or even better accuracy in describing flow field and flow-structure interaction, as demonstrated by several test simulations. Therefore, this boundary method could be considered as a competitive alternative for boundary treatment in LBM simulations, especially for particulate and porous flows with large fluid–solid interfacial areas.},

Three typical problems in high-speed viscous ﬂow, namely, compressible boundary layer problem, the shock wave problem and the shock boundary layer interaction problem are solved with current lattice Boltzmann simulation. In addition, indepth comparisons are made up on the non-oscillatory and non-free-parameter dissipation scheme with second order upwind scheme in present lattice Boltzmann model. Simulation results indicate the great potential of lattice Boltzmann method for simulating high-speed compressible viscous ﬂows with boundary layer.

	abstract = {Numerous schemes have been proposed to incorporate a bulk forcing term into the lattice Boltzmann equation. In this paper we present a simple and straightforward comparative analysis of five popular schemes in which their differences and similarities are identified. From the analysis we classify the schemes into two groups; the behaviors of the schemes in each group are proven to be identical up to second order. Numerical test simulating the two-dimensional unsteady Taylor-Green vortex flow problem demonstrate that all five schemes are of comparable accuracy for single-phase flow. However, for two-phase flow the situation is different, which is demonstrated by incorporating these schemes into different Shan-Chen-type multiphase models. The forcing scheme in the original Shan-Chen (SC) multiphase model turns out to be inaccurate in terms of the resulting surface tension for different density ratios and relaxation times. In the numerical tests, a typical equation of state and interparticle interactions including next-nearest neighbors were incorporated into the SC model. Our results confirm that the surface-tension values obtained from the original SC lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) simulation depend on the value of the relaxation time τ. For τ{\textless}0.7Δt, the surface tension agree well with the analytical solutions. However, when τ{\textgreater}0.7Δt, the surface tension turns out to be systematically larger than the analytical one, exceeding it by more than a factor of 2 for τ=2Δt. In contrast, with the application of the scheme proposed by He, the SC LBM produces very accurate surface tensions independent of the value of τ. We also found that the densities of the coexisting liquid and gas can be adjusted to match those at thermodynamic equilibrium if the particle interaction term includes next-nearest-neighbor contributions. The obtained results will be useful for further studies of two-phase flow with high density ratios using the SC LBM approach.},

	abstract = {Properties of porous materials, abundant both in nature and industry, have broad influences on societies via, e.g. oil recovery, erosion, and propagation of pollutants. The internal structure of many porous materials involves multiple scales which hinders research on the relation between structure and transport properties: typically laboratory experiments cannot distinguish contributions from individual scales while computer simulations cannot capture multiple scales due to limited capabilities. Thus the question arises how large domain sizes can in fact be simulated with modern computers. This question is here addressed using a realistic test case; it is demonstrated that current computing capabilities allow the direct pore-scale simulation of fluid flow in porous materials using system sizes far beyond what has been previously reported. The achieved system sizes allow the closing of some particular scale gaps in, e.g. soil and petroleum rock research. Specifically, a full steady-state fluid flow simulation in a porous material, represented with an unprecedented resolution for the given sample size, is reported: the simulation is executed on a CPU-based supercomputer and the 3D geometry involves 16,3843 lattice cells (around 590 billion of them are pore sites). Using half of this sample in a benchmark simulation on a GPU-based system, a sustained computational performance of 1.77 PFLOPS is observed. These advances expose new opportunities in porous materials research. The implementation techniques here utilized are standard except for the tailored high-performance data layouts as well as the indirect addressing scheme with a low memory overhead and the truly asynchronous data communication scheme in the case of CPU and GPU code versions, respectively.},

We provide a detailed comparison between these novel techniques through the parallelisation of a two-dimensional lattice Boltzmann method based fluid flow solver. Our comparison between the CUDA and UPC parallelisation takes into account the required conceptual effort, the performance gain, and the limitations of the approaches from the application oriented developers’ point of view. We demonstrated that UPC led to competitive efficiency with the local memory implementation. However, the performance of the shared memory code fell behind our expectations, and we concluded that the investigated UPC compilers could not efficiently treat the shared memory space. The CUDA implementation proved to be more complex compared to the UPC approach mainly because of the complicated memory structure of the graphics card which also makes GPUs suitable for the parallelisation of the lattice Boltzmann method.},

A block-structured dynamic adaptive mesh reﬁnement (AMR) procedure tailored for LBM is applied to enable computationally efﬁcient simulations of moderate to high Rayleigh number ﬂows which are characterized by a large scale disparity in boundary layers and free stream ﬂow. As test cases, the analytically accessible problem of a two-dimensional (2D) forced convection ﬂow through two porous plates and the non-Cartesian conﬁguration of a heated rotating cylinder are considered. The objective of the latter is to advance the boundary conditions for accurate treatment of curved boundaries and to demonstrate the effect on the solution. The effectiveness of the overall approach is demonstrated for the natural convection benchmark of a 2D cavity with differentially heated walls at Rayleigh numbers from 103 up to 108. To demonstrate the beneﬁt of the used AMR procedure for three-dimensional (3D) problems, results from the natural convection in a cubic cavity at Rayleigh numbers from 103 up to 105 are compared with benchmark results.},

	abstract = {A double-distribution-function based lattice Boltzmann method (DDF-LBM) is proposed for the simulation of polyatomic gases in the supersonic regime. The model relies on a numerical equilibrium that has been extensively used by discrete velocity methods since the late 1990s. Here, it is extended to reproduce an arbitrary number of moments of the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. These extensions to the standard 5-constraint (mass, momentum and energy) approach lead to the correct simulation of thermal, compressible flows with only 39 discrete velocities in 3D. The stability of this BGK-LBM is reinforced by relying on Knudsen-number-dependent relaxation times that are computed analytically. Hence, high Reynolds-number, supersonic flows can be simulated in an efficient and elegant manner. While the 1D Riemann problem shows the ability of the proposed approach to handle discontinuities in the zero-viscosity limit, the simulation of the supersonic flow past a NACA0012 aerofoil confirms the excellent behaviour of this model in a low-viscosity and supersonic regime. The flow past a sphere is further simulated to investigate the 3D behaviour of our model in the low-viscosity supersonic regime. The proposed model is shown to be substantially more efficient than the previous 5-moment D3Q343 DDF-LBM for both CPU and GPU architectures. It then opens up a whole new world of compressible flow applications that can be realistically tackled with a purely LB approach.
