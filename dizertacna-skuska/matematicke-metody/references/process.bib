abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The process model for BOF process can be applied to predict the liquid steel composition and bath temperature during the whole steelmaking process. On the basis of the traditional three-stage decarburization theory, the concept of mixing degree was put forward, which was used to indicate the effect of oxygen jet on decarburization. Furthermore, a more practical process model for BOF steelmaking was developed by analyzing the effect of silicon, manganese, oxygen injection rate, oxygen lance height, and bath temperature on decarburization. Process verification and end-point verification for the process model have been carried out, and the verification results show that the prediction accuracy of carbon content reaches 82.6{\%} (the range of carbon content at the end-point is less than 0.1wt{\%}) and 85.7{\%} (the range of carbon content at end-point is 0.1wt{\%}-0.7wt{\%}) when the absolute error is less than 0.02wt{\%} and 0.05wt{\%}, respectively. {\textcopyright} University of Science and Technology Beijing and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.},

Given the advantages of artificial neural network, it was used to predict end-point manganese content during BOF steelmaking process, and BP neural network model was esta blished. By means of combining the characteristics of genetic algorithm and BP neural network completely, a combined GA-BP neural network model was established. The verification and comparison of the above three models show that the combined GA-BP neural network model has the highest prediction accuracy. The hit rate of the combined GA-BP neural network model is 90{\%} and 84{\%} respectively when predictive errors of the model are within ±0.03{\%} and ±0.025{\%}. Compared with two models aboved, the combined GA-BP neural network model could provide the most accurate prediction of end-point manganese content, and thus represents a good reference for real production. {\textcopyright} 2012 ISIJ.},

It is usually difficult to build a precise BOF endpoint dynamic model because many input variables affect the endpoint carbon content and temperature. For this problem, two effective variables selection steps: mechanism analysis and mutual information calculation are proposed to choose appropriate input variables according to a variable selection algorithm. Then, the selected inputs are weighted on the basis of mutual information values. Finally, two input weighted support vector machine BOF endpoint dynamic models are constructed to predict endpoint carbon content and temperature. Results show that the variable selection for BOF endpoint prediction model is essential and effective.

abstract = {Mathematical modeling of the combined side and top blowing AOD refining process of stainless steel has further been studied. A new model proposed is generally based on the analysis and assumptions made for the process in our previous investigation. Particularly, the heat transfer characteristics of the vessel are ana- lyzed in terms of the two-dimensional transient heat-conduction problems of composite walls. The heat and mass balances of the system are more comprehensively and precisely performed. The model has been ap- plied to 28 heats of 304-grade austenitic stainless steel refining in a 120 t AOD converter. The results pres- ent that the changes in the composition and temperature of the liquid steel with the time during the whole process can be accurately predicted using the model. The competitive oxidation among the elements in the steel during the oxidative refining with the relevant oxygen distribution ratios, and the competitive reduction of the oxides in the slag during the Ar agitating and reductive refining with the appropriate oxygen supply ra- tios can be well characterized and reasonably determined using the Gibbs free energies of the reactions. The critical carbon concentrations (after which the decarburization alters to be limited by the mass transfer of carbon in liquid steel) for the top, side and combined blowing of 304-grade steel in this work are in the ranges of 0.895 to 0.942, 0.078 to 0.224, 0.144 to 0.255 mass{\%}, respectively. The effects of some factors on the refining result and the optimization of blowing technology have been considered from the model pre- dictions. The model can provide a reliable basis and useful information for determining and optimizing the technology of this AOD process of stainless steel, and controlling the process in real time and on-line.},

Related operating results are introduced. A new process route which is based on hot metal and chromium ore is outlined. The cost advantage for the production of 304 stainless steel grade is higher than 100 US/ton. The synthesis of electric arc furnace (EAF) and oxygen converter steelmaking, a comparison of decarburization rates, refining combustion burners for optimized oxygen management in an EAF and an example for a large advanced EAF are outlined. Possibilities of flexible steelmaking and the growth and outlook of worldwide oxygen steelmaking are described.Cet article examine l’histoire, le développement et 10 étapes clés des procédés d’élaboration de l’acier à l’oxygène, avec une attention spéciale aux convertisseurs autothermes conventionnels, aux convertisseurs à haute vitesse avec taux de soufflage jusqu’à 5 m3 n/t min (m3 d’O2 normal par tonne métrique d’acier par minute) et aux convertisseurs allothermes avec addition de charbon, l’après combustion et la possibilité d’augmenter le taux de ferraille jusqu’à 50\%. On introduit les résultats d’opération qui y sont associés. On souligne une nouvelle séquence de traitement qui est basée sur le métal chaud et le minerai de chrome. L’avantage économique de la production d’acier inoxydable de nuance 304 est de plus de 100 U.S/tonne. On souligne la synthèse de l’élaboration de l’acier au four électrique à arc (EAF) et au convertisseur à oxygène, une comparaison des taux de décarburation, des brûleurs de combustion d’affinage pour une gestion optimisée de l’oxygène dans un EAF et un exemple pour un grand EAF d’avant-garde.

	abstract = {Slag–metal emulsion plays an important role in the oxidation kinetics of metalloids in oxygen steelmaking. The importance of droplet generation rate, droplet size, and its residence time in the slag–metal emulsion on the overall reaction kinetics has become evident in recent times. Residence times of the droplets are strongly dependent on the decarburization rate, the CO bubbles giving a buoyant force to the droplets. The present work aims at developing a mathematical model for predicting the composition evolutions of the slag and the metal phases as the blow proceeds in an LD converter. The process dynamics are modeled by dividing the LD convertor into three separate continuous stirred tank reactors. Oxidation reactions are assumed to be primarily taking place at the interface between the slag and the metal phases in the emulsion. Among the different mass transfer and reaction steps controlling the kinetics, the mass transfer of FeO in the slag phase and that of the metalloids within the metal droplet are assumed to be rate-controlling. For a Fe-C-X (X = Mn, Si etc.) droplet, simultaneous removal of elements have been modeled by Gibbs' free energy minimization at the slag–metal interface. Effects of droplet size, mass transfer coefficient, and initial carbon content on the mean residence time of metal droplets in the slag–metal emulsion have also been identified. Mixing in the metal phase is simulated in terms of metal exchange rate and the reactor weight ratio between the upper and the lower parts of the bath.},

To overcome the problem that fractional order gradient method cannot converge to real extreme point, a simplified fractional order gradient method is designed based on Caputo’s definition. The parameters within layers are updated by the designed gradient method, but the propagations between layers still use integer order gradients, and thus the complicated derivatives of composite functions are avoided and the chain rule will be kept. By connecting every layers in series and adding loss functions, the proposed convolutional neural networks can be trained smoothly according to various tasks. Some practical experiments are carried out in order to demonstrate fast convergence, high accuracy and ability to escape local optimal point at last."

	abstract = {A three-dimensional mathematical model has been developed to simulate the compressible jets flow from the top-blown lance with multi-nozzles in converter to a free surrounding domain. The variations of fluid density and viscosity, high temperature, and Mach number were taken into consideration in this model which was validated against the physical modeling results. More specifically, computations were obtained to compare the widely used realizable k-$\epsilon$ turbulence model against the standard k-$\omega$ turbulence model, which shows that the latter one is superior to calculate diverse turbulent conditions within the multiple jets. Moreover, the coalescence pattern of the multiple jets has been illustrated by their Mach number distribution, and each individual jet proceeds in a curve course, bending to the lance center and tending to unite. The effects of the inclination angles on the jets coalescence were also investigated, which indicates that the lower the inclination angle is, the stronger the interfering extent between the multiple jets is. With the help of this model, the dynamic power of the multiple jets to support the cavity formation was demonstrated, and additionally, a mathematical model concerning the effective penetration radius and digressing path of the multiple jets was proposed by taking the inclination angle and the axial distance from the nozzle tips as arguments. {\textcopyright} 2010 ISIJ.},

	abstract = {Experimental measurements are reported describing the velocity field in an inductively stirred low melting alloy. The molten metal was held in a cylindrical container, 500 mm high and having an inside diameter of 250 mm; induction stirring was supplied by a three phase coil, which provided a maximum field strength of 350 Gauss (0.035 Wb/m2). The velocities in the melt were measured by a mechanical force reaction probe and were found to range up to about 0.5 m/s. Theoretical prediction of the melt velocities was made by solving Maxwell's equations, together with the turbulent Navier-Stokes equations, using a digital computer. The experimentally measured and theoretically predicted velocities were found to agree within about 30 pct, thus providing direct experimental proof for the validity of modelling electromagnetically driven flows using this technique.},

@book{Petras2011,
	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},
