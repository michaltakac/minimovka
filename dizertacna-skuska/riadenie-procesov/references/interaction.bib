abstract = {Interactive visualization plays a key role in the analysis of large datasets. It can help users to explore data, investigate hypotheses and find patterns. The easier and more tangible the interaction, the more likely it is to enhance understand-ing. This paper presents a tabletop Tangible User Interface (TUI) for interactive data visualization and offers two main contributions. First, we highlight the functional requirements for a data visualization interface and present a tabletop TUI that combines tangible objects with multi-touch interaction. Second, we compare the performance of the tabletop TUI and a multi-touch interface. The results show that participants found patterns faster with the TUI. This was due to the fact that they adopted a more effective strategy using the tabletop TUI than the multi-touch interface.},

@article{Malinverni2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.We present a qualitative, idiographic study aimed at exploring how children create bridges between embodied experience and meaning construction while interacting with a Full-Body Interaction Learning Environment. Starting from the analysis of four case studies, we illustrate different possible paths through which children can transform embodied experience into an 'object-to-think-with' and delineate the different resources for meaning making that they employed. These outcomes contribute to expand the current understanding around embodied learning with interactive technologies, as well as suggest a set of qualities to think about interaction design and future research.},

@article{Dangeti2016,
abstract = {3D modeling is used in Computer Graphics in various fields. Since the growth of gestures, virtual reality and embodied cognition, there have been various new technologies developed to either improve the modeling efficiency, or to provide more nature intuitive experience to the users. In this paper, from the user experience perspective, we try to compare these methods for navigation of 3D objects in the virtual modeling environment including: simple bare hand gestures, tangible user interfaces (TUI) with object in hand, as well as mouse/keyboard as the primary input. Based on embodied cognition theory, we hypothesis that the object-in-hand method might bring better user experience since the interaction between the object and hand can enhance the user's cognition while navigating a model. We present a conceptual design, with two approaches and three design models which demonstrate differences in user interaction with 3D modeling software.},

abstract = {Information visualisation is the transformation of abstract data into visual, interactive representations. In this paper we present InfoPhys, a device that enables the direct, tangible manipulation of visualisations. InfoPhys makes use of a force-feedback pointing device to simulate haptic feedback while the user explores visualisations projected on top of the device. We present a use case illustrating the trends in ten years of TEI proceedings and how InfoPhys allows users to feel and manipulate these trends. The technical and software aspects of our prototype are presented, and promising improvements and future work opened by Info-Phys are then discussed.},

abstract = {This article introduces a new interaction model called Instrumental Interaction that extends and generalizes the principles of direct manipulation. It covers existing interaction styles, including traditional WIMP interfaces, as well as new interaction styles such as two-handed input and augmented reality. It defines a design space for new interaction techniques and a set of properties for comparing them. Instrumental Interaction describes graphical user interfaces in terms of domain objects and interaction instruments. Interaction between users and domain objects is mediated by interaction instruments, similar to the tools and instruments we use in the real world to interact with physical objects. The article presents the model, applies it to describe and compare a number of interaction techniques, and shows how it was used to create a new interface for searching and replacing text. Keywords},
