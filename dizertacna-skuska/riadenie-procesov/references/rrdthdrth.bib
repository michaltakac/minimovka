abstract = {Experimental measurements are reported describing the velocity field in an inductively stirred low melting alloy. The molten metal was held in a cylindrical container, 500 mm high and having an inside diameter of 250 mm; induction stirring was supplied by a three phase coil, which provided a maximum field strength of 350 Gauss (0.035 Wb/m2). The velocities in the melt were measured by a mechanical force reaction probe and were found to range up to about 0.5 m/s. Theoretical prediction of the melt velocities was made by solving Maxwell's equations, together with the turbulent Navier-Stokes equations, using a digital computer. The experimentally measured and theoretically predicted velocities were found to agree within about 30 pct, thus providing direct experimental proof for the validity of modelling electromagnetically driven flows using this technique.},
