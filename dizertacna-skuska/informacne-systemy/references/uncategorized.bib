abstract = {Information on energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions from the iron and steel industry may become important to the assessment of energy saving and the design of emissions trading schemes. This paper focuses monitoring aspects, used two methods to calculate CO 2 emission, the European Union Emission Trading Scheme and a method developed by the Japanese Iron and Steel Federation, to investigate the effect of the accounting method on the assessment of energy saving by four model steel mills with different levels of energy efficiency. Depending on the calculation method used, the calculated energy savings and calculated CO 2 emissions for a given mill were found to differ from 5{\%} to 15{\%} and 4{\%} to 14{\%} respectively, simply by using different calculation methods. Methodologies that evaluate only CO 2 emission and track emissions by process may not fully account for energy saving efforts such as using waste heat, generating power using byproduct gases, and energy management efforts applied over the whole mill rather than on a single process. Points of concern in the iron and steel industry are identified in the areas of calculating energy saving, determining CO 2 emissions, and setting benchmarks. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Alam2010,
abstract = {Supersonic oxygen jets are used in steelmaking and other different metal refining processes, and therefore, the behavior of supersonic jets inside a high temperature field is important for understanding these processes. In this study, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed to investigate the effect of a high ambient temperature field on supersonic oxygen jet behavior. The results were compared with available experimental data by Sumi et al. and with a jet model proposed by Ito and Muchi. At high ambient temperatures, the density of the ambient fluid is low. Therefore, the mass addition to the jet from the surrounding medium is low, which reduces the growth rate of the turbulent mixing region. As a result, the velocity decreases more slowly, and the potential core length of the jet increases at high ambient temperatures. But CFD simulation of the supersonic jet using the $\kappa$-∈ turbulence model, including compressibility terms, was found to underpredict the potential flow core length at higher ambient temperatures. A modified $\kappa$-∈ turbulence model is presented that modifies the turbulent viscosity in order to reduce the growth rate of turbulent mixing at high ambient temperatures. The results obtained by using the modified turbulence model were found to be in good agreement with the experimental data. The CFD simulation showed that the potential flow core length at steelmaking temperatures (1800 K) is 2.5 times as long as that at room temperature. The simulation results then were used to investigate the effect of ambient temperature on the droplet generation rate using a dimensionless blowing number. {\textcopyright} The Minerals, Metals {\&} Materials Society and ASM International 2010.},

@article{Chen2010,
abstract = {Previous work in the authors' laboratory has shown that an understanding of droplet swelling is essential in predicting droplet residence times in basic oxygen steelmaking. Several workers have observed swelling of high carbon droplets when exposed to oxidising slags. In the present work, the authors present data on swelling rates measured by X-ray fluoroscopy and compare this with the total volume of gas evolved during the reaction. It is shown that only a small percentage of the gas generated is retained in the droplet to contribute to swelling. The gas generation rate is shown to be controlled by the rate of nucleation of CO bubbles inside the droplet. The critical supersaturation pressure for nucleation is found to be two orders of magnitude less than predicted from theory, which is in keeping with many other studies on nucleation of gases in liquids. However, the effect of surface tension, temperature and saturation pressure shows quantitative agreement with theory. {\textcopyright} 2010 Maney Publishing.},

@article{Lee2003,
abstract = {Physical modelling of the basic oxygen furnace (BOF) was undertaken with the object of developing an overall flow pattern within the vessel as a function of fluid-flow dynamics/vessel geometry interaction. The study was initiated as the result of localised refractory wear occurring in the knuckle region of a BOF vessel. The occurrence of the wear coincided with a change in lance tip design. This preferential wear limited the campaign life of the vessel. Modelling the fluid dynamics of the system was to examine any possible relationship between fluid-flow patterns and this refractory wear pattern. The 4-fold symmetry of the newer lance tip allowed the application of a quadrant sector model of the bath. This simplified the flow to the effect of an individual nozzle. A scale of 1/6th was chosen on the basis of the bath depth and flow rates required. Results from this work indicate that waves may have a role in this localised wear. The multiphase system of the BOF involving supersonic gas jets, molten iron and slag, and the interaction between these, ensure that there is no single model, in which all facets of similarity may be satisfied simultaneously. This is the major problem in modelling the BOF. {\textcopyright} Blackwell Publishing, 2003.},

@article{Lv2013,
abstract = {The basic oxygen furnace (BOF) smelting process consists of different chemical reactions among oxygen, slag, and molten steel, which engenders a vigorous stirring process to promote slagging, dephosphorization, decarbonization, heating of molten steel, and homogenization of steel composition and temperature. Therefore, the oxygen flow rate, lance height, and slag thickness vary during the smelting process. This simulation demonstrated a three-dimensional mathematical model for a 100 t converter applying four-hole supersonic oxygen lance and simulated the effect of oxygen flow rate, lance height, and slag thickness on the flow of molten bath. It is found that as the oxygen flow rate increases, the impact area and depth increases, which increases the flow speed in the molten bath and decreases the area of dead zone. Low oxygen lance height benefits the increase of impact depth and accelerates the flow speed of liquid steel on the surface of the bath, while high oxygen lance height benefits the increase of impact area, thereafter enhances the uniform distribution of radial velocity in the molten steel and increases the flow velocity of molten steel at the bottom of furnace hearth. As the slag thickness increases, the diameter of impinging cavity on the slag and steel surface decreases. The radial velocity of liquid steel in the molten bath is well distributed when the jet flow impact on the slag layer increases. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Minerals, Metals {\&} Materials Society and ASM International.},
