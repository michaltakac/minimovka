	abstract = {Mathematical modeling of the combined side and top blowing AOD refining process of stainless steel has further been studied. A new model proposed is generally based on the analysis and assumptions made for the process in our previous investigation. Particularly, the heat transfer characteristics of the vessel are ana- lyzed in terms of the two-dimensional transient heat-conduction problems of composite walls. The heat and mass balances of the system are more comprehensively and precisely performed. The model has been ap- plied to 28 heats of 304-grade austenitic stainless steel refining in a 120 t AOD converter. The results pres- ent that the changes in the composition and temperature of the liquid steel with the time during the whole process can be accurately predicted using the model. The competitive oxidation among the elements in the steel during the oxidative refining with the relevant oxygen distribution ratios, and the competitive reduction of the oxides in the slag during the Ar agitating and reductive refining with the appropriate oxygen supply ra- tios can be well characterized and reasonably determined using the Gibbs free energies of the reactions. The critical carbon concentrations (after which the decarburization alters to be limited by the mass transfer of carbon in liquid steel) for the top, side and combined blowing of 304-grade steel in this work are in the ranges of 0.895 to 0.942, 0.078 to 0.224, 0.144 to 0.255 mass{\%}, respectively. The effects of some factors on the refining result and the optimization of blowing technology have been considered from the model pre- dictions. The model can provide a reliable basis and useful information for determining and optimizing the technology of this AOD process of stainless steel, and controlling the process in real time and on-line.},

	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	abstract = {Through analyzing the factors that influence end-point manganese content during BOF steelmaking process, multiple linear regression model for prediction of end-point manganese content was obtained on the basis of actual production data. Given the advantages of artificial neural network, it was used to predict end-point manganese content during BOF steelmaking process, and BP neural network model was esta blished. By means of combining the characteristics of genetic algorithm and BP neural network completely, a combined GA-BP neural network model was established. The verification and comparison of the above three models show that the combined GA-BP neural network model has the highest prediction accuracy. The hit rate of the combined GA-BP neural network model is 90{\%} and 84{\%} respectively when predictive errors of the model are within ±0.03{\%} and ±0.025{\%}. Compared with two models aboved, the combined GA-BP neural network model could provide the most accurate prediction of end-point manganese content, and thus represents a good reference for real production. {\textcopyright} 2012 ISIJ.},

	abstract = {The process model for BOF process can be applied to predict the liquid steel composition and bath temperature during the whole steelmaking process. On the basis of the traditional three-stage decarburization theory, the concept of mixing degree was put forward, which was used to indicate the effect of oxygen jet on decarburization. Furthermore, a more practical process model for BOF steelmaking was developed by analyzing the effect of silicon, manganese, oxygen injection rate, oxygen lance height, and bath temperature on decarburization. Process verification and end-point verification for the process model have been carried out, and the verification results show that the prediction accuracy of carbon content reaches 82.6{\%} (the range of carbon content at the end-point is less than 0.1wt{\%}) and 85.7{\%} (the range of carbon content at end-point is 0.1wt{\%}-0.7wt{\%}) when the absolute error is less than 0.02wt{\%} and 0.05wt{\%}, respectively. {\textcopyright} University of Science and Technology Beijing and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.},

It is usually difficult to build a precise BOF endpoint dynamic model because many input variables affect the endpoint carbon content and temperature. For this problem, two effective variables selection steps: mechanism analysis and mutual information calculation are proposed to choose appropriate input variables according to a variable selection algorithm. Then, the selected inputs are weighted on the basis of mutual information values. Finally, two input weighted support vector machine BOF endpoint dynamic models are constructed to predict endpoint carbon content and temperature. Results show that the variable selection for BOF endpoint prediction model is essential and effective. The complexity and precise of two endpoint prediction models are improved. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
