	abstract = {The recent advances in computer graphics has spurred interest from both academics and industries in virtual reality (VR) enabled training applications. This paper presents a desktop VR prototype for industrial training applications. It is designed and implemented as a general shell by providing the data interface to import both the virtual environment models and specific domain knowledge. The geometric models of the virtual environment are constructed using feature-based modelling and assembly function by external CAD tools, and then transferred into the prototype through a conversion module. A hierarchical structure is proposed to partition and organise these imported virtual environment models. Based on this structure, a visibility culling approach is developed for fast rendering and user interaction. The case study has demonstrated the functionality of the proposed prototype system by applying it to a maintenance training application for a refinery bump system, which, in general, has a large number of polygons and a certain depth complexity. Significant speedup in both context rendering and response to user manipulations has been achieved to provide the user with a fast system response within the desktop virtual environment. Compared with the immersive VR system, the proposed system has offered an affordable and portable training media for industrial applications. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag London Limited 2004.},
