abstract = {Designing a usable learning application is one of the key factors in ensuring effective learning. This article introduces modified group usability testing (MGUT) as a feasible framework for evaluating the usability of non-immersive virtual reality (VR) learning applications. Conventionally, usability testing of such learning applications often employs the one-to-one approach in which an evaluator conducts testing with several individual participants. As opposed to the one-to-one approach, the group approach involves several-to-many participants performing tasks simultaneously, with several evaluators observing and interacting with participants. This article describes the complete step-by-step procedure for conducting MGUT to uncover usability problems of a VR learning application that aims to educate its users on fire safety and prevention. It also proposes methods to analyze these usability problems. The effectiveness and efficiency of MGUT was then compared with DGUT, the original group testing technique and cooperative evaluation (CE), which is a typical one-to-one approach. Results indicate that all three techniques are able to reveal usability problems of different usability factors and show similar capability to discover the most critical and serious problems. MGUT is more effective than DGUT as it can collect additional usability problems of various factors and of different levels of severity. MGUT is as effective as CE as both techniques can identify usability problems which are more or less comparable in terms of quantity and quality. As for efficiency, MGUT and DGUT are more efficient than CE as these group testing approaches require lesser testing time, lesser effort in terms of the intensive interaction with participants although with slight more effort in the preparation of the physical setting. In addition, it is also obvious that MGUT and DGUT involve richer participation than CE. MGUT is also more feasible than DGUT as it allows some flexibility in the computer arrangement setting.

abstract = {In this paper, we explore the use of printed tangible props as input devices for scientific visualization. Three-dimensional printing technology is used to create a physical representation of data. The object is then used as a tangible input prop, which exactly matches the data. In addition, two-handed interaction with a stylus is performed on the prop without the use of buttons, instead relying on the detection of contact between the stylus and the prop through precise calibration and tracking. This allows the sense of touch to be harnessed to create a more efficient and natural interaction method for scientific visualizations in virtual and augmented reality. We explain the concept of tangible props and where it can be applied. We also consider the technical requirements of systems using such props. Finally, we present our example application, which uses printed tangible props for interactive measurement of marine coral data. The use of tangible props is found to improve the usability of the application.},

@article{Shen2018,
abstract = {The use of virtual reality (VR) has become a viable alternative to conventional learning methods in various knowledge domains. Wearable head-mounted displays (HMDs) are devices that provide users with an immersive VR experience. To investigate the direct determinants affecting students' reasons for HMD use in learning, hypotheses relating to information technology acceptance and Kolb's learning styles were proposed and tested in this study. Participants were recruited through stratified random sampling according to the population ratio of colleges at a university in Taiwan. Students were shown a video on VR applications in learning, after which an online survey was completed. In total, 387 questionnaires were collected of which 376 were valid. An inference analysis of the samples was performed by structural equation modelling with eight exogenous latent variables, namely the four constructs of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) and the four modes of Kolb's learning styles. All eight variables pointed to one endogenous latent variable: behavioural intention. The results showed all four constructs of the UTAUT to have a positive and significant effect on students' behavioural intention to use HMDs in learning and only the concrete experience mode of Kolb's learning styles to have a positive and significant effect. Based on these findings, this study provides suggestions on how to encourage HMDs use in learning to VR developers and educational institutions. {\textcopyright} 2018 Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature},

@article{Bossard2008,
abstract = {The aim of all education is to apply what we learn in different contexts and to recognise and extend this learning to new situations. Virtual learning environments can be used to build skills. Recent research in cognitive psychology and education has shown that acquisitions are linked to the initial context. This provides a challenge for virtual reality in education or training. A brief overview of transfer issues highlights five main ideas: (1) the type of transfer enables the virtual environment (VE) to be classified according to what is learned; (2) the transfer process can create conditions within the VE to facilitate transfer of learning; (3) specific features of VR must match and comply with transfer of learning; (4) transfer can be used to assess a VE's effectiveness; and (5) future research on transfer of learning must examine the singular context of learning. This paper discusses how new perspectives in cognitive psychology influence and promote transfer of learning through the use of VEs. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag London Limited 2008.},

abstract = {In the past, the term e-learning referred to any method of learning that used electronic delivery methods. With the advent of the Internet however, e-learning has evolved and the term is now most commonly used to refer to online courses. A multitude of systems are now available to manage and deliver learning content online. While these have proved popular, they are often single-user learning environments which provide little in the way of interaction or stimulation for the student. As the concept of lifelong learning now becomes a reality and thus more and more people are partaking in online courses, researchers are constantly exploring innovative techniques to motivate online students and enhance the e-learning experience. This article presents our research in this area and the resulting development of CLEV-R, a Collaborative Learning Environment with Virtual Reality. This web-based system uses Virtual Reality (VR) and multimedia and provides communication tools to support collaboration among students. In this article, we describe the features of CLEV-R, its adaptation for mobile devices and present the findings from an initial evaluation. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {As humans start to spend more time in collaborative virtual environments (CVEs) it becomes important to study their interactions in such environments. One aspect of such interactions is personal space. To begin to address this, we have conducted empirical investigations in a non immersive virtual environment: an experiment to investigate the influence on personal space of avatar gender, and an observational study to further explore the existence of personal space. Experimental results give some evidence to suggest that avatar gender has an influence on personal space although the participants did not register high personal space invasion anxiety, contrary to what one might expect from personal space invasion in the physical world. The observational study suggests that personal space does exist in CVEs, as the users tend to maintain, in a similar way to the physical world, a distance when they are interacting with each other. Our studies provide an improved understanding of personal space in CVEs and the results can be used to further enhance the usability of these environments.},

In order to examine this relationship, different environments (immersive and interactive, immersive but passive, and non-virtual) have been designed to support a set of tasks for primary school students between 8 and 12 years old. The tasks are constructive by nature, including such things as the assembly of columns from parts or the re-design of a playground, and require performing mathematical calculations.

abstract = {The aim of using virtual reality (VR) as a medical training tool is to offer additional means to teach students and to improve the quality of medical skills. A novel system was developed to fulfil the requirements of modern medical education and overcome the challenges faced by both students and lecturers in the process of knowledge transfer. A heart three-dimensional model presented in a virtual reality (VR) environment has been implemented in order to facilitate a new educational modality. This paper reports the outcome of a comparative study between traditional medical teaching modalities and virtual reality technology. This study was conducted in the Faculty of Medicine in the University of Jordan. The participants were asked to perform system trials and experiment with the system by navigating through the system interfaces, as well as being exposed to the traditional physical model of the human heart that is currently used in the faculty during practical anatomy sessions. Afterwards, they were asked to provide feedback via a comparative questionnaire. The participants' replies to the questions regarding the Physical Heart Model and VR heart anatomy system were assessed for reliability using Cronbach's alpha. The first group's (Physical Heart Model questions) $\alpha$ value was 0.689. The second group's (VR heart anatomy system questions) $\alpha$ value was 0.791. Comparing students' experience results between the traditional method (Physical Heart Model) and the VR heart anatomy system, the mean scores showed a distinct increase in the values. This indicates that the developed system enhanced their experience in anatomy learning and the provided tools improved their understanding of heart anatomy. Results demonstrated the usefulness of the system by showing a higher satisfaction rate for the provided tools regarding structure and visualisation. {\textcopyright} 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract = {The recent advances in computer graphics has spurred interest from both academics and industries in virtual reality (VR) enabled training applications. This paper presents a desktop VR prototype for industrial training applications. It is designed and implemented as a general shell by providing the data interface to import both the virtual environment models and specific domain knowledge. The geometric models of the virtual environment are constructed using feature-based modelling and assembly function by external CAD tools, and then transferred into the prototype through a conversion module. A hierarchical structure is proposed to partition and organise these imported virtual environment models. Based on this structure, a visibility culling approach is developed for fast rendering and user interaction. The case study has demonstrated the functionality of the proposed prototype system by applying it to a maintenance training application for a refinery bump system, which, in general, has a large number of polygons and a certain depth complexity. Significant speedup in both context rendering and response to user manipulations has been achieved to provide the user with a fast system response within the desktop virtual environment. Compared with the immersive VR system, the proposed system has offered an affordable and portable training media for industrial applications. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag London Limited 2004.},

abstract = {The Virtual Trillium Trail is a new kind of desktop virtual reality application that crosses over into the area of geospatial, educational simulations. Visual fidelity significantly impacts intrinsic learning, activity in situ, and knowledge gained, independent of other factors. The main empirical contribution of this report is on the impact of the user interface design parameters of graphical fidelity and navigational freedom on learning outcomes. A planned orthogonal contrast, Two-way ANOVA with the factors of Visual Fidelity and Navigational Freedom-both scaled, and set to high and low levels-shows significant impacts on the variables of Salient Events, a proxy for discovery-based learning, and Knowledge Gained, as measured between a pre-test and a post-test. Thus, there is strong empirical evidence to support the use of desktop virtual environments, built with high-fidelity, photo-realistic, and free navigational game engine technology, as educational simulations for informal education. The high-level Visual Fidelity combined with the high-level Navigational Freedom condition showed a mean learning gain of 37.44{\%} and is significantly superior to the low-level Visual Fidelity, low-level Navigational Freedom condition, ceteris paribus.},

abstract = {While it has been suggested that immersive virtual environments could provide benefits for educational applications, few studies have formally evaluated how the enhanced perceptual displays of such systems might improve learning. Using simplified memorization and problem-solving tasks as representative approximations of more advanced types of learning, we are investigating the effects of providing supplemental spatial information on the performance of learning-based activities within virtual environments. We performed two experiments to investigate whether users can take advantage of a spatial information presentation to improve performance on cognitive processing activities. In both experiments, information was presented either directly in front of the participant, at a single location, or wrapped around the participant along the walls of a surround display. In our first experiment, we measured memory scores and analyzed participant strategies for a memorization and recall task. In addition to comparing spatial and non-spatial presentations, we also varied field of view and background imagery. The results showed that the spatial presentation caused significantly better memory scores. Additionally, a significant interaction between background landmarks and presentation style showed that participants used more visualization strategies during the memorization task when background landmarks were shown with spatial presentations. To investigate whether the advantages of spatial information presentation extend beyond memorization to higher level cognitive activities, our second experiment employed a puzzle-like task that required critical thinking using the presented information. Focusing only on the effects of spatial presentations, this experiment measured task performance and mental workload. The results indicate that no performance improvements or mental workload reductions were gained from the spatial presentation method compared with a non-spatial layout for our problem-solving task. The results of these two experiments suggest that supplemental spatial information can affect mental strategies and support performance improvements for cognitive processing and learning-based activities. However, the effectiveness of spatial presentations is dependent on the nature of the task and a meaningful use of space and may require practice with spatial strategies.},

abstract = {Human–Computer interaction, including technology-aided instruction, is beginning to focus on virtual reality (VR) technology due to its ability to support immersive learning, teaching through simulation, and gamification of learning. These systems can deliver high-level multisensory learning experiences that are important in the teaching of many subjects, especially those involving abstract concepts or requiring spatial skills, such as organic chemistry. Haptic experiences with VR, however, remain a challenge. In addition, development has focused on general entertainment/gaming; VR systems in chemistry implement simulations of the chemistry laboratory and other advanced systems whereas those that support safe, game-like, immersive and multisensory learning of organic chemistry with haptics at pre-university education levels are scarce. We developed the VR Multisensory Classroom (VRMC) as an immersive learning environment within a VR head-mounted display, where learners employ hand movements to build hydrocarbon molecules and experience haptic feedback through gloves with built-in sensors and hand-tracking with the Leap Motion system. We report here the evaluation of the first prototype by learners from diverse backgrounds who reported on the ability of the VRMC to support high engagement, motivation, interest and organic chemistry learning as well as diverse learning styles. The VRMC is a novel VR classroom that supports immersive learning in molecular organic chemistry with haptics for multisensory learning. {\textcopyright} 2018 Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature},

abstract = {An empirical analysis was performed to compare the effectiveness of different approaches to training a set of procedural skills to a sample of novice trainees. Sixty-five participants were randomly assigned to one of the following three training groups: (1) learning-by-doing in a 3D desktop virtual environment, (2) learning-by-observing a video (show-and-tell) explanation of the procedures, and (3) trial-and-error. In each group, participants were trained on two car service procedures. Participants were recalled to perform a procedure either 2 or 4 weeks after the training. The results showed that: (1) participants trained through the virtual approach of learning-by-doing performed both procedures significantly better (i.e. p {\textless} .05 in terms of errors and time) than people of non-virtual groups, (2) the virtual training group, after a period of non-use, were more effective than non-virtual training (i.e. p {\textless} .05) in their ability to recover their skills, (3) after a (simulated) long period from the training---i.e. up to 12 weeks---people who experienced 3D environments consistently performed better than people who received other kinds of training. The results also suggested that independently from the training group, trainees' visuospatial abilities were a predictor of performance, at least for the complex service procedure, adj R 2 = .460, and that post-training performances of people trained through virtual learning-by-doing are not affected by learning styles. Finally, a strong relationship (p {\textless} .001, R 2 = .441) was identified between usability and trust in the use of the virtual training tool---i.e. the more the system was perceived as usable, the more it was perceived as trustable to acquire the competences.},

abstract = {The vast majority of Web-based technology, its ability to visualize static and time varying information and the pervasive nature of its content have lead the development of applications and user interfaces that port between a broad range of operating systems, databases and devices. However the integration of this immense resource in virtual environments (VEs) remains elusive. In this paper we present a Web scriptable user interface that utilizes Web browser technology to enable the user to search the internet for arbitrary information and to seamlessly augment this information into the VE. WebVRI provides access to the standard data input and query mechanisms offered by conventional Web browsers, with the difference that it generates active texture-skins of the Web contents that can be mapped onto arbitrary surfaces within the environment. Once mapped, the corresponding texture functions as a fully integrated Web-browser that will respond to traditional events such as the selection of links or text input. As a result, any surface within the environment can be turned into a Web-enabled resource that provides access to user-definable data. Using WebVRI, users can merge Web contents into their VE, control its behavior and collaborate with other users inside and outside the VE. This provides a completely new mechanism to access readily available Web-based data, documents, images, animations, simulations and visualization. WebVRI also enables game-based education by providing the ability to create contents rich, pervasive VR-based edutainment environments.},

abstract = {In an empirical evaluation, we examined the effect of viewing condition on psychophysical skills education in an interactive 3D simulation to train users in electrical circuitry. We compared an immersive head-mounted display (HMD)-based viewing metaphor versus a limited, desktop-based virtual reality (DVR) viewing metaphor with interaction using a spatial user interface. Psychophysical skills education involves the association of cognitive functions with motor functions to make the task autonomous with repeated practice. In electrical circuitry, this is demonstrated by the fine movements involved in handling and manipulating components on the electrical circuit, particularly while measuring electrical parameters. We created an interactive circuitry simulation (IBAS) where participants could learn about electrical measurement instruments such as the ammeter, voltmeter and multimeter, in a simulated breadboard VR system. Twenty-four participants utilized the simulation (12 in each condition), and the quantitative and qualitative aspects of psychophysical skills education with respect to the viewing metaphor were examined. Each viewing condition in IBAS was head-tracked and non-stereoscopic. Perspective correction was coupled with head-tracking in the DVR condition. The key quantitative measures were cognitive questionnaires addressing different levels of Bloom's cognitive taxonomy and a real-world psychophysical task addressing various levels of Dave's psychomotor taxonomy. The qualitative measures were the Witmer–Singer sense of presence questionnaire and self-report. Results suggest that there was a significant increase in cognition post-experiment in both DVR and HMD viewing conditions in levels of knowledge, application, analysis and evaluation. Results also revealed a significant learning benefit with respect to the higher level concepts pertaining to evaluation in the HMD condition as compared to DVR. Participants seem to have enjoyed a greater level of affordance in task performance and spent a larger amount of time to complete the simulated exercises as well as manually maneuvered to further distances in the HMD viewing condition as compared to DVR viewing.},

abstract = {In this article, efficient computational models for ship motions are presented. These models are used to simulate ship movements in real time. Compared with traditional approaches, our method possesses the ability to cope with different ship shapes, engines, and sea conditions without the loss of efficiency. Based on our models, we create a ship motion simulation system for both entertainment and educational applications. Our system assists users to learn the motions of a ship encountering waves, currents, and winds. Users can adjust engine powers, rudders, and other ship facilities via a graphical user interface to create their own ship models. They can also change the environment by altering wave frequencies, wave amplitudes, wave directions, currents, and winds. Therefore, numerous combinations of ships and the environment are generated and the learning becomes more amusing. In our system, a ship is treated as a rigid body floating on the sea surface. Its motions compose of 6 degrees of freedom: pitch, heave, roll, surge, sway, and yaw. These motions are divided into two categories. The first three movements are induced by sea waves, and the last three ones are caused by propellers, rudders, currents, and winds. Based on Newton's laws and other basic physics motion models, we deduce algorithms to compute the magnitudes of the motions. Our methods can be carried out in real time and possess high fidelity. According to ship theory, the net effects of external forces on the ship hull depend on the ship shape. Therefore, the behaviors of the ship are influenced by its shape. To enhance our physics models, we classify ships into three basic types. They are flat ships, thin ships, and slender ships. Each type of ship is associated with some predefined parameters to specify their characteristics. Users can tune ship behaviors by varying the parameters even though they have only a little knowledge of ship theory. Springer-Verlag London Limited 2008.},

Since classical times, people have used memory palaces as a spatial mnemonic to help remember information by organizing it spatially and associating it with salient features in that environment. In this paper, we explore whether using virtual memory palaces in a head-mounted display with head-tracking (HMD condition) would allow a user to better recall information than when using a traditional desktop display with a mouse-based interaction (desktop condition). We found that virtual memory palaces in HMD condition provide a superior memory recall ability compared to the desktop condition.

Adapting the difficulty level of the experience to the users' affect state fosters their engagement which is a crucial issue in educational environments and prevents boredom and anxiety.

However, few studies have investigated the influence of the mechanism of virtual experience on users' mood and loyalty. To compensate for this research gap, this study aims to evaluate consumers' virtual experience by examining the flow state in a virtual environment. A total of 368 valid questionnaires were collected, and a structural equation modeling approach was employed in the data analysis. The study reveals that forming flow involves many factors: the intrinsic charac- teristics of the mediated environment, the consumer's assumptions and perceptions prior to entering the flow state, the stage at which the customer enters the flow state, and the consequences of the flow experience.},

Then, we describe a blended interaction design studio course on the basis of this approach, which ran through a whole semester. We found that the VW design studio is an engaging and constructive experience for students: In the VW environment, students and tutors held many online meetings, and students constructed several models about their design project, developed a digital prototype and conducted a remote usability evaluation. In addition, the persistence of the environment and the developed VW tools helped students and tutors to achieve careful feedback and reflection during the design project lifetime. Nevertheless, a number of challenges remain for wider implementation: the refinement of the instructional design approach, the usability of VW tools, further integration of VWs to professional design tools and the conduction of other full-scale VW design studio courses. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag London.},

abstract = {Bare hand interaction (BHI) allows users to use their hands and fingers to interact with digital content without any attached devices or accessories. For BHI to realize widespread adoption, interaction techniques for fundamental operations, like grasp-and-release, need to be identified and optimized. This paper presents a controlled usability evaluation of four common visual feedback techniques in grasp-and-release tasks using bare hand interaction (BHI). The techniques are ‘object coloring,' ‘connecting line,' ‘shadow' and ‘object halo.' The usability was examined in terms of task time, accuracy, errors and user satisfaction. A software test bed was developed for two interface configurations: using the Leap Motion controller alone (desktop configuration) and using the Leap with Oculus Rift (virtual reality (VR) configuration). Participants (n 32) performed four trials × five feedback techniques × two UI (user interface) configurations, i.e., a total of 1280 trials. The results can be summarized into: (a) user performance is significantly better in the VR configuration compared to the desktop; (b) coloring techniques for visual feedback (‘object coloring' and ‘object halo') are more usable than ‘connecting line' regardless of UI; (c) in the VR, coloring techniques remain more usable, while in the desktop interface the ‘shadow' technique is also usable and preferred by users, (d) the ‘connecting line' technique often distracts users from grasp-and-release tasks on static targets. (e) Some visual feedback is always preferred by users than none in both VR and desktop. We discuss these findings in terms of design recommendations for bare hands interactions that involve grasp-and-release tasks.},

abstract = {This study employed electroencephalography to record event-related potentials to investigate the difference in learning performance between learners with different levels of spatial ability in a traditional learning environment that utilizes presentation slides and a learning environment that incorporates virtual reality (VR). Thirty-two university students participated in the experiment. The N1 and P2 components were results that indicated selective attention at an early stage; their amplitudes were proportional to the cognitive loads. The experiment results revealed that the main effect of learning environment was significant. The N1 and P2 components had larger amplitudes and indicated higher cognitive loads in the presentation slides-based environment than in the VR-based environment. The main effect of spatial ability was also significant. The N1 and P2 amplitudes evoked in the high spatial ability (HSA) learners were smaller than those evoked in the low spatial ability (LSA) learners, indicating that the LSA learners possessed fewer cognitive resources and bore relatively high cognitive loads. The interaction effect of learning environment and spatial ability was significant. Larger P2 amplitude was observed in LSA learners in the presentation slides-based environment than in the VR-based environment, implying that VR facilitates the reduction of cognitive loads in LSA learners. The P2 amplitude detected in HSA learners did not show any significant difference in both learning environments, indicating that the VR-based learning environment did not enhance their learning. This result supports the ability-as-compensator hypothesis to a certain extent.},

abstract = {There is no doubt that an abundance of factors exists that makes learning with serious games successful. Research articles reporting on these factors, however, tend to focus on select serious game elements and do not combine all salient factors for successful learning with serious games. Addressing this gap is a necessity for the success of serious games and may even alleviate long-standing debates about pedagogy over enjoyment, how much realism is enough or whether artificial intelligence is worth the cost. This article examines existing academic literature from 2000 to 2015, extracting shared serious game success factors that have had an encouraging impact on gameful learning experiences. As such, we subsequently aim to withdraw the field from a perpetual spiral of does-my-game-work research toward more worthwhile why-does-my-game-not-work research. Qualitative content analysis through the constant comparison method (CCM) analyzed a total of 63 articles from a variety of recognized electronic libraries and databases. Through this analysis, we reveal five central serious game themes: backstory and production; realism; artificial intelligence and adaptivity; interaction; and feedback and debriefing, all of which require deliberate intertwining with pedagogical content to ensure successful learning. This review unravels each of the five themes into their constituent factors and consequently presents the factors as practical guidelines that serious games producers should strive to include in their game productions. Applying these recommendations whenever serious games are considered will provide a foundation for effective gameful learning experiences.},

abstract = {The recent changes in Virtual Reality (VR) revived the interest in the field and strongly affected HCI research. Under these developments, the problem-solving capacity of HCI research in VR is examined and discussed in this work. A literature review of 63 publications is utilised to examine the type of research problems that the HCI research in the VR field addresses, over the last three years. The results show that recent HCI research in VR mainly addresses constructive problems. The underrepresentation of empirical and conceptual problems shows that the conducted research may have lower problem-solving capacity than desired. We address the findings by arguing for the field's need to investigate more empirical problems and formulate more conceptual work, re-set and re-examine past research questions under the new prism, as well as improve its dissemination process.},

@article{Araujo2016,
abstract = {Augmented and virtual reality have the potential of being indistinguishable from the real world. Holographic displays, including head mounted units, support this vision by creating rich stereoscopic scenes, with objects that appear to float in thin air - often within arm's reach. However, one has but to reach out and grasp nothing but air to destroy the suspension of disbelief. Snake-charmer is an attempt to provide physical form to virtual objects by revisiting the concept of Robotic Graphics or Encountered-type Haptic interfaces with current commodity hardware. By means of a robotic arm, Snakecharmer brings physicality to a virtual scene and explores what it means to truly interact with an object. We go beyond texture and position simulation and explore what it means to have a physical presence inside a virtual scene. We demonstrate how to render surface characteristics beyond texture and position, including temperature; how to physically move objects; and how objects can physically interact with the user's hand. We analyze our implementation, present the performance characteristics, and provide guidance for the construction of future physical renderers.},

@article{Doh2013,
abstract = {The present article treats different phenomena taking place in a steelmaking converter through the development of two separate models. The first model describes the cavity produced at the free surface of the metal bath by the high-speed impinging oxygen jet. The model is based on a zonal approach, where gas compressibility effects are taken into account only in the high velocity jet region, while elsewhere the gas is treated as incompressible. The volume of fluid (VOF) method is employed to follow the deformation of the bath free surface. Calculations are presented for two- and three-phase systems and compared against experimental data obtained in a cold model experiment presented in the literature. The influence on the size and shape of the cavity of various parameters and models (including the jet inlet boundary conditions, the VOF advection scheme, and the turbulence model) is studied. Next, the model is used to simulate the interaction of a supersonic oxygen jet with the surface of a liquid steel bath in a pilot-scale converter. The second model concentrates on fluid flow, heat transfer, and the post-combustion reaction in the gas phase above the metal bath. The model uses the simple chemical reaction scheme approach to describe the transport of the chemical species and takes into account the consumption of oxygen by the bath and thermal radiative transfer. The model predictions are in reasonable agreement with measurements collected in a laboratory experiment and in a pilot-scale furnace. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Minerals, Metals {\&} Materials Society and ASM International.},

abstract = {This paper presents a web-based interactive teaching package that provides a comprehensive and conducive yet dynamic and interactive environment for a module on automated machine tools in the Manufacturing Division at the National University of Singapore. The use of Internet technologies in this teaching tool makes it possible to conjure visualisations that cannot be achieved using traditional teaching materials such as transparencies. Virtual reality simulations and animations were developed and appropriately placed in the teaching materials to enhance the student understanding of complex concepts. This is especially useful in teaching automated machine tools, which deals primarily with the numerical control (NC) of the motions of automated machine tools. These virtual reality simulations and animations provide the capability of training students in NC programming and operations without the need to work on actual NC machines in the laboratory. The simulations are suitably placed in the package to engage the students and enhance their concentration, while at the same time generate interactions. Customised question types were also designed and implemented with a tutorial monitoring application. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
